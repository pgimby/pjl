\begin{adjustwidth}{}{-158pt}
\nointerlineskip\leavevmode

The operational details of the laboratory component of Physics 325 are outlined here. We hope you find these experiments an interesting and helpful part of your physics education. Many of the experiments in this course are chosen to be unlike any you have performed before. None of these modern experiments were imagined or even technically feasible until the early portion of the twentieth century.
 
\section{Why are there labs in Physics 325?}

\begin{itemize}
\item To experience nuclear physics, particle interactions, and quantum phenomena first-hand.
\item To gain experience with new measurement instruments and laboratory techniques that are essential to many other areas of experimental physics.
\item To understand the statistical nature of nuclear physics.
\item To experience the extraordinary sensitivity of instruments that are capable of detecting individual particles produced by nuclear decays and very small currents.
\end{itemize}

\section{Laboratory Schedule}

For the first half of the course, all groups do the same lab at the same time. For the second half of the course each group does a different project lab each week. At the end
of the course a poster session is held. Each laboratory group is required to present a poster about an experiment of their choice. The laboratory schedule is presented here.
The schedule for all laboratories is also posted in the display case across from 
room ST039.

\begin{table}[h!]

\end{table}

There are 7 project experiments available and you must choose five.  You will work with your TA to schedule when you perform these experiments.  This should be done before 
the Reading Break.

The Laboratory Manual for Physics 325 is available online at \\ www.pjl.ucalgary.ca

\section{General laboratory procedures}

The laboratory portion of this course is structured such that you are assigned to a lab section and expected to attend the lab every week on a particular day and time. You 
must be familiar with the lab write-up before you arrive for the lab. You must complete the pre-lab exercises before you arrive at the lab in order to get credit for them. 
The regular labs take roughly 3 hours to complete, while the project labs take from 3 hours to a week depending upon the experiment. Except for the project experiments, the 
experiment, including data analysis and report writing, should be completed during the three-hour lab period. 

Each lab in the lab manual has the same general format. There is an introductory section that provides background information and a theoretical basis for the experiment that
you will be carrying out. After the introduction is a detailed, step-by-step procedure to lead you through the laboratory exercise. When doing these steps try to understand
why the write-up asks you to do each step, rather than just following it blindly. After the procedure is a section on uncertainty analysis. Some hints for assigning errors to
instruments and propagation of errors are provided. Finally, there is the lab worksheet, which explains what is expected from you for pre-lab work and the experiment write-up. 
Your laboratory grade assignment is based on the evaluation of the pre-lab and write-up. 

Before coming to the lab, read all parts of the write-up and complete the pre-lab requirements. You will find it difficult to complete the lab in the time provided if you 
have not first read over the lab and thought about what you are going to do.

Your laboratory station is a shared workplace. For this reason, after you complete your experiment, you should clean up your laboratory station. This includes brushing 
eraser shavings and other litter into the garbage and storing laboratory stools underneath the worktables. All equipment must be turned off but remain plugged in. If some 
instruments or samples were obtained from elsewhere in the laboratory, they must be returned there.

\section{What should you record when conducting an experiment?}

You will want to make sure that there is sufficient detail to complete the report and you might include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Date when the record is entered
\item Names and contact information of your laboratory partners
\item Details of the apparatus, including model numbers, serial numbers, etc.
\item Sketch of the experiment (circuit diagram, sketch of layout of components on the bench...)
\item Measured data and uncertainties in tables
\item Example calculations
\item Graphs to explore the behaviour of the data
\item Observations of events that might impact the experiment
\end{itemize}

It is highly recommended that you use a bound laboratory notebook to record the details and results of your experiment. Laboratory notebooks are available from the 
University book store or any office supply store.  Using a bound notebook will ensure that you have a complete record of your experiment and you will not lose or misplace 
individual sheets of paper.  A laboratory notebook is essential in any professional environment and maintaining a careful record of your work is an important habit to 
develop.

Any loose sheets should be stapled or blued in the laboratory notebook.  For example, you may wish to include photographs, excerpts from other documents, graphs, tables, 
spreadsheets, etc. in the notebook.  The origin of these appended pages should be recorded.  For example, provide the reference of the cited work, file name of the 
spreadsheet, or the name and version of the software package used to generate a graph.

\section{What should comprise the laboratory report?}

Communication is an important part of Science and the laboratory report is the key way you share your results and conclusions with your instructor, colleagues, and the 
scientific community.  It is essential to create a document for a specific target audience. You will want to demonstrate that you understand the concepts developed in the 
laboratory.  Therefore, you should make sure that you provide sufficient detail in the presentation of the data, calculations, and subsequent analysis so your TA will know 
that you understand the work you did in the laboratory.  In future courses you will perform experiments that will require you to present your results in the form of a 
scientific paper or technical report.

\vspace{12pt}

Unless otherwise directed, your laboratory report should include the following items:

\begin{itemize}
\item Name of the experiment and date it was performed
\item Names of your laboratory partners
\item Your responses to the Calculations, Analysis, and Discussion in the laboratory manual.  This will probably include tables with measured and calculated data, including
units and uncertainties and graphs of measured or calculated data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tips about Lab Evaluation}

Each lab may have several different types of questions, listed numerically following the progression of the lab write-up. Different questions ask different things about the
experiment. Some will require answers written in complete sentences. Other questions ask you to provide derivations, fill in data tables, plot graphs, carry out 
calculations, do error analysis, or analyse your results. Your TA will have some basic expectations. These are outlined briefly below. However, please remember that neatness
is essential! If your reports are messy, disorganized, or difficult to follow the TAs are instructed to deduct significant marks.

Several parts of each lab will ask you questions about the lab and/or your results. These are the main portions of the lab that give you the opportunity to demonstrate to 
your TA that you understand the lab. 

You will often be asked to provide derivations or proofs of relevant equations. These are often listed as pre-lab work and can be done in advance.  When doing a derivation,
make sure that each step is clear.  Include explanations of steps where necessary, and make sure that the logical sequence is complete. When you are provided with the 
starting equation and the final equation you are only being evaluated on the intermediate process, so make sure it makes sense. Once again, neatness counts because if it is 
difficult to follow with equations spread all over the page, then it is not a derivation.

There are very significant sections of the labs that ask you to record data in tabular form. These sections will be marked for the quality and quantity. Make sure that:

\begin{itemize}
\item You have as much data as requested.
\item Your data is legible. 
\item Your data is well organized and clear. You should be look at the page and very quickly be able to understand what was recorded.
\item All your data has units, reasonable significant figures, and uncertainties. There are a very few exceptions where uncertainties are not required for some of the data.
These exceptions are clearly noted in the lab write-ups.
\item All data in a table has units clearly associated with it. It is acceptable to include the units in the header for a row or column when it is clear that all entries in
that row or column have the same units.
\item All tables that have calculations associated with them should have sample calculations near the table. Remember to include units, proper significant figures, and 
uncertainties when ever applicable.
\end{itemize}

Once you have the data recorded, you are often required to plot the data or some quantity calculated from the data.  Once again, the plots need to be clear and 
understandable, and they must accurately reflect the collected data.  Marks will be deducted for messiness or for inaccurate plotting.  Every plot or graph needs an 
informative  title, and clear, identifying labels on each axis.  The units of the data plotted along each axis must be clearly identified, and the absolute, quantitative 
scale must be clearly labelled with evenly spaced numerical values.  The data points should be accurately plotted and easily identified.  All data should have error bars 
associated with each point.  If for some reason it is not possible to give error bars, there should be a note on the plot giving a reasonable explanation for the lack of 
error bars.  Reasonable explanations may include that the uncertainties are too small to be seen on the scale of the graph, or that the write-up specifically said not to 
calculate uncertainties on a quantity.

Once the data is plotted, you will often be asked to determine a linear fit to the data.  In this course, the laboratory graphing program should be used to get 
coefficients of lines of best fit. This program works best because it properly handles errors in x and y simultaneously. The best fit line should be drawn on the plot, and 
the slope and y-intercept shown.  Remember that slopes and intercepts do usually have units and errors from the fit and these need to be recorded correctly as well. The 
process of carrying out all requested data calculations should be demonstrated either on the plot or nearby. Use of spreadsheets for data analysis tasks is encouraged except 
for finding lines of best fit. Analytical questions related to the results are often asked near the end of the lab. Answer these thoughtfully, and ensure that your answer 
agrees with your data.

\section{Lab grading standards}

Just showing up for a lab will not equate to a 100\% lab mark. The work will be marked in accordance with generally accepted university-level grading standards, as listed 
below.


\vspace{12pt}
\noindent \textbf{80-100} Excellent: superior performance showing comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. \\

\noindent \textbf{70-79}  Good: clearly above average performance with knowledge of subject matter generally complete. \\

\noindent \textbf{60-69} Satisfactory: basic understanding of the subject material.\\

\noindent \textbf{50-59} Minimal Pass: marginal performance; generally insufficient performance for subsequent courses in the same subject.\\

\noindent \textbf{<49} Fail: unsatisfactory Performance or Failure to meet course requirements.\\

The TAs have been instructed to try to set an evaluation standard that they will maintain throughout the course.  This means that a lab performance of a quality that 
receives a 75\% in January, would also be awarded a 75\% if the lab was done in November. In other words, the expectations for lab performance will not increase over the 
course of the term.  In practice, what this generally means is that lab marks tend to be lower in the early part of a course.  However, as you learn and improve the 
standards of your work over the course of the term, the marks begin to rise, often ending up relatively high by the last lab of the course.


\section{Concluding Comments}

This laboratory has been developed in the hope of providing you, the student, with an interesting and exciting hands-on introduction to the world of experimental Physics. 
We would like to encourage you to take an interest in the material of this course and to ask questions whenever they arise. Start with your TA, and if he or she cannot deal
with the question, take it up with you course instructor, but please, do not just sit around wondering. The best way to learn is to ask.

\chapter{Laboratory Safety}

\section{Introduction}
People who survive to reach adulthood generally acquire a mental list of safety rules that are followed to prevent injury to themselves and others. These rules are learned 
from sources such as parents, teachers, and experience. However, the practice of experimental physics can involve the handling of materials, instruments, and processes that
lie outside the realm of common experience. The rules described here must be added to your mental list to handle these new situations. This is part of your education in 
physics. For the safety of yourself and others you are required to read, understand, and follow these guidelines.

All of the physics experiments you will perform have been designed with the safety of the student in mind. This necessarily assumes that all the apparatus is used in a 
reasonable manner. Do not mishandle or abuse the equipment. Use your common sense. Always maintain an awareness of the consequences of your actions for yourself and others.
No food, drink, or smoking is permitted in the laboratory, to reduce the chance that it will be contaminated before being consumed. Also, spilled drinks can be dangerous 
near electrical equipment. Some physics experiments use ice or ice water for cooling. Do not eat or drink the ice or ice water, since it may be contaminated. Never work in a
laboratory alone, there should always be someone else present to get help if necessary. In the event of any accident in the lab, you must notify your instructor immediately.
The following comments describe the hazards you may encounter while in a physics laboratory and the relevant safety procedures to follow.

\section{Heavy Metals}
Lead is used for shielding in radiation experiments. Heavy metals such as lead can be absorbed into your body through the skin and mouth. They accumulate in the brain and 
eventually cause brain damage when a large enough amount is present. The total dosage of lead in the brain builds up over your lifetime as a function of total  accumulated 
exposure. Minimize your exposure to lead in the laboratory by handling it as little as possible. Do not touch any food or your face while working with lead. Wash your hands
after handling lead objects. Lead is also very dense. Be aware of this when moving blocks of lead and do not drop them.

Observe the same precautions when doing an experiment that uses mercury. As with lead, mercury can also be absorbed into the body to accumulate over your lifetime. Mercury 
has the added properties that it is a liquid which can be spilled and any open container of liquid mercury produces mercury vapour which can be inhaled. Avoid spilling 
mercury and try to keep it in a sealed container if possible. Make sure there is a spill tray underneath any experiment that involves the use of mercury. If mercury does get
spilled, notify your instructor so that it can be cleaned up. 

\section{Radiation}
The total dose of radiation you receive depends on the source intensity, the time you are exposed, and your distance from the source. For x-rays and gamma-rays the source 
intensity drops as the inverse square of the distance. For alpha and beta particles the drop is even faster. Minimize the time that a radioactive source is near you. Keep 
radioactive sources  as far away from you as you reasonably can, consistent with doing the experiment. There are strict regulations about the storage and handling of 
radioactive sources. Do not open, drop or lose them.

\section{Lasers}
Lasers are sources of concentrated parallel beams of monochromatic light, which can quite easily be focussed to tiny spots where the power density is high enough to cause 
damage. Never look into a laser beam, or let it shine into your eye, since you may suffer retinal damage if the laser power is high enough. Reflections from polished 
surfaces are almost as dangerous as the direct beam. Never shine a laser into someone elseâs eyes. Resist the temptation to shine the laser around the room or into the 
hallway. If this is done a person could accidentally gaze into the beam.

\section{Rotating Machinery}
Some experiments use pumps, motors, or other moving mechanisms. Keep fingers and other appendages away from such devices. Be especially careful about long hair and 
loose clothing.

\section{Electricity}
Always wire together your circuits with the power off. Make sure the circuit power is off when changing or moving components around. If you must work on live 
circuits only touch the insulated portions and make sure one hand is in your pocket or behind your back. This eliminates the possibility of current flow through the heart 
and lungs, which can be fatal. Do not touch live exposed connections under any circumstances. Beware of loose wires which can fall off or make unintentional connections, 
usually with undesirable results. Be especially vigilant around high voltage circuits. If the voltage is high enough, it is not necessary to touch the circuit to get a 
shock, since sparks can jump across a gap of air. Capacitors require particular care since they can store charge internally for hours after being disconnected from a 
circuit. Make sure capacitors are discharged before touching the terminals. When using spark timers on the air tracks make sure the hands of all your lab partners are clear
before starting the spark source.

\section{Cryogenic Materials}
Some physics experiments involve the use of liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, dry ice, or an organic solvent cooled with dry ice. These materials are cold. Do not touch them 
with your hands. Wear protective gloves when handling a container containing a cryogenic material. Do not splash or spill these cold liquids. Be careful not to touch parts 
that have been in contact with a cryogenic material, they will be cold as well. If a spill does happen, notify your instructor but do not touch the spill, it will evaporate
naturally. There must always be a way for evaporated cryogenic liquid to escape from a vessel, otherwise a dangerous build-up of pressure will occur.

\section{Pressure and vacuum vessels}
Gas bottles are under high pressure. If they are breached they will explode with the force of a bomb. Never jar or mishandle a pressure vessel when it is pressurized. 
Vacuum systems will implode when breached. Do not jar or abuse them either. Always bring the vacuum (or pressure) back to normal slowly. Before adjusting any valves make 
sure you understand the purpose of each valve and the consequences of operating it. Turn it slowly at first so you can change your mind if something seems to be wrong.

\section{Microwaves}
People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting electro-metallic implants should refrain from doing physics experiments that involve microwaves.

\section{Strong Magnetic Fields}
Strong magnetic fields will erase your credit cards, computer disks, and audio tapes. They will also damage watches, tape players, and other electronic devices. Do not leave
any such objects near a strong magnet or electromagnet. Check the area around an electromagnet before turning it on. People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting
electro-metallic implants should also refrain from doing physics experiments that involve powerful magnetic fields. Anything containing a magnet, or magnetic material like 
iron, steel, nickel, or cobalt, should also be kept away from strong magnetic fields. They may be damaged or pulled into the region of the field with enough force to break 
something.

\section{Stroboscopes}
Some people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or severe migraine headaches if they view strobe lights flashing at a frequency of 5 to 25 Hz. Refrain from doing an 
experiment involving strobe lights if you know you are susceptible. Notify the instructor immediately if you see someone adversely affected by an operating stroboscope.

\section{\Huge \bf I. Radiation Safety }

The following document on radiation safety was assembled from documentation prepared by the University of Calgary Environment, Health, and Safety Office. 

\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Terminology}}

{\bf Activity} -- Is the measure of the number of radioactive nuclei that change or disintegrate per unit time (for example per second).  The unit of activity used is the Becquerel.  One Becquerel represents 1 nuclear disintegration per second.\\ 

{\bf Exposure} -- The Roentgen (R) is the old unit of exposure and is defined or measured as the ability of photons to produce ionization in air. The roentgen is no longer used in radiation protection, as it applies only to photons (gamma and x-rays) and is related only to their effect in air. The S.I. unit has no name; the units are Coulomb per kilogram.\\

{\bf Absorbed Dose} -- The Gray (Gy) is defined as the amount of energy deposited per unit mass of tissue. The absorbed dose can result from all types of radiation in any material. One gray (Gy) = 1 joule per kg of mass and it is necessary to define the absorbing material when using grays as a unit for absorbed dose. One Gray will produce various levels of tissue damage depending on the type of radiation.\\

{\bf Equivalent Dose} -- The dose equivalent or Sievert (Sv) is the amount of energy absorbed in a given mass multiplied by a quality factor (Q), which is specific for each type of radiation.\\
\begin{equation}
1\ Sv = 1\ Gy \times Q
\label{equ:rsUnits}
\end{equation}

Quality factors for various type of ionizing radiation are listed below. The higher the quality factor, the higher the absorbed energy damage in tissues.

\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Types of Radiation}}

{\bf Alpha particles} are doubly charged helium nuclei (He$^{2+}$). Sources of alpha radiation are common in nature and include thorium, uranium, and radium. Alpha emitting radioisotopes with one exception (Sm-147) have atomic numbers greater than eighty-two. Alpha particles are highly energetic. Alpha particles have energies of 4 MeV or greater. A thin absorber such as a sheet of paper or the dead layer of the skin easily stops alpha particles. Alpha sources do not present a great hazard external to the body. Inside the body, however, alpha emitters are highly significant, because the alpha particle is doubly charged and relatively massive. The alpha particle undergoes many interactions with surrounding atoms, depositing all its energy in a very small volume.\\

{\bf Beta decay} involves the emission of a negative beta (negatron) which is an electron, which originates from the nucleus or the emission of a positron, the "anti-matter" of the negatron. The mass is identical to the beta but unlike the negative beta it has a positive charge. Therefore, a beta particle is an unpaired singly charged electron possessing kinetic energy. The higher the energy of the particle, the greater the ability of the particle to penetrate a material. Low-energy beta particles (less than 0.2 MeV) are easily absorbed in the outer layer of skin; beta-emitting sources external to the body present a somewhat greater threat of penetration when compared to alpha emitters. Sources inside the body within cells or incorporated into biologically active molecules may give significant radiation doses that disable and kill cells. \\

{\bf Photons} (Gamma and x-ray radiations) have no mass, and are uncharged electromagnetic radiation that can pass through matter. Gamma and x-rays ionize materials, through which they pass, causing excited electrons to be ejected from the atomic structure. Gamma and x-rays have identical physical characteristics, and differ only in how they are produced. The penetrating ability of gamma and x-rays makes them biological hazards whether they are external or internal. Gamma rays result from the emission of energy as an excited nucleus drops from one energy level to a lower energy state. X-rays result from transitions within the electron cloud of an atom or are emitted when a charged particle is quickly decelerated by running into dense material. \\

{\bf Neutron} radiation is the least common in the research laboratory. The absorption properties of neutrons are very complex as compared to charged particles and electromagnetic radiation. Neutron absorption is a function of the absorber's atomic weight, neutron to proton ratio, and interaction probabilities with various nuclei. Exposure to neutron radiation is a concern as the biological damage from sources external and internal to the body is greater than equivalent amounts of beta and gamma radiation.\\

\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Natural Background Radiation}}

Naturally occurring background levels of radiation can typically range from 1.0 to 3.5 mSv per year and in some places can be much higher. Background in Calgary is between 1.2 and 1.8 mSv per year. The highest known widespread level of background radiation is in Kerala and Madras States in India where a population of over 100,000 people receive an annual dose rate, which averages 13 mSv, due to the higher levels of terrestrial radiation. In Ramsar Iran, inhabitants who live in some houses in this area receive annual doses as high as 132 mSv from the local terrestrial sources. \\

The average person in Calgary receives approximately between 2 -- 3 mSv every year from naturally occurring background radiation as well as man-made sources.  Approximately 80 \% of the dose is from natural sources of radiation.  Radon is a major component of that exposure. \\

\label{tbl:rsExposure}
\caption{Common sources of radiation exposure, and their average doses per year}
%\end{center}
\end{table}

Cosmic radiation consists of high-energy particulate radiation produced in the stars and our own sun that bombard the earth and makes the atoms in the upper atmosphere radioactive. Sunshine Village, at an altitude of one mile, has a cosmic radiation intensity of about 0.5 mSv/yr compared to an intensity of about 0.25 mSv/yr observed at sea level. Calgary's cosmic radiation level is approximately 0.40 mSv/yr. \\

Terrestrial (Natural radioactivity) radiation consists of penetrating gamma and x-rays that result from the radioactive decay of naturally occurring, radioactive materials (for example, potassium, uranium, thorium, etc.) found in the earth's crust.  Most building materials contain some small amounts of radioactivity. The average Canadian population dose equivalent is 0.35 mSv per year. \\

Radon is an inert gaseous element resulting from the decay of uranium. Since radon is a gas, it readily escapes from soil, especially if the soil has been disturbed in any way. Radon-222 has a half-life of 38 days which produces several radioactive elements collectively referred to as "radon daughters" which are not gases and, therefore, precipitate out of the atmosphere by attaching themselves to dust particles in the air. Estimates of the average dose equivalent to the lungs vary, but the average effective dose equivalent for Canada is around 1 mSv per year. \\

Internal radiation exposure results from the presence of naturally occurring radionuclides (K-40, C14, H-3, etc.) ingested into the body like non-radioactive elements. Potassium is an important part of our body and the food system. Potassium is incorporated into many tissues and contributes more than 95\% of the internal dose experienced by the population. Potassium-40 makes up 0.0117\% of all potassium.  The average dose equivalent due to internal radionuclides is approximately 0.35 mSv per year. \\

\newpage
\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Effects of Radiation}}

Radiation causes ionizations in the molecules of living cells. These ionizations result in the removal of electrons from the atoms and form ions. The ions formed go on to react with other atoms and cause damage in the cell. An example of damage would be a gamma ray, which passes through the cell. The water molecules near the DNA might be ionized and the ions might react with the DNA and cause the bonds to break. \\

The doses that we receive every day from background radiation are low and the cells can repair radiation-induced damage rapidly.  Cells might not be able to repair the damage at higher doses (up to 1000 mSv) and these cells may either be changed permanently or die.  The body can replace most cells that die. However, cells changed permanently may go on to produce abnormal cells. These abnormal cells may become cancerous under the right circumstances.  This is the origin of our increased risk to cancer as a result of radiation exposure. \\

Radiation biology is the study of interactions between any type of radiation and living organisms or organic materials.  The energy absorption initiates the effects that are observed in living irradiated systems. No effects are produced, if the radiation is transmitted, scattered or reflected, or if the energy is otherwise not absorbed. Biological effects are roughly proportional to the amount of energy absorbed. \\

When any agent (chemicals, radiation, excessive heat, etc.) damages a cellular component, a multitude of measurable effects can result. The type of cell damage will depend upon what the specific agent is that the cell is exposed to.  Also, the amount of damage will be related to how much of the agent reaches that particular kind of cell. The changes maybe initially restricted to either a single cell or a few types of cells. Whole organs or organ systems may be affected in time due to the absence of a required function that upsets the equilibrium or control of the whole-interrelated system.  Any alteration of the genetic information carried by the genes, or of the processes associated with mitosis can result in either a permanent change in the nature of the cell (mutation), or in the cell's death. \\

Radiation passing through living cells causes ionization or excitation of atoms and molecules contained in the cell. The human body is comprised of large amounts of water.  Water molecules are the most likely targets for being hit by photons or charged particles. The reaction is the formation of an ion pair: H$_{2}O^{+}$ and an electron e$^{-}$.  The H2O$^{+}$ is rapidly hydrated $H_{2}O^{+} + H_{2}O \to H_{3}O^{+} + OH^{*}$. Here the OH$^{*}$ is a "free radical"; a species that contains an unpaired orbital electron and is highly chemically reactive. The electron will also react with a water molecule $e^{-} + H_{2}O \to H_{3}O^{-} + OH^{*}$. After the electron slows down from bumping into other water molecules, it will yield another free radical, this time hydrogen. The products are separated by a considerable distances so that immediate back reactions to form water are not favoured. \\

The radicals can combine with each other and with any number of other molecules with a cell (dissolved oxygen to give a variety of potent oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, molecular oxygen, and the perhydroxy radical).  \\

Both the initial radicals and by-products can migrate to biologically important molecules (like DNA) and cause bond breakage and/or oxidation of attached functional groups. The energy of the radiation is transferred to biologically significant molecules, by changing their structure (bond breakage) or chemical reactivity (oxidation of functional group).  This form of energy-transfer is known as the INDIRECT EFFECT and accounts for a significant fraction of the damage in cells. \\

The actual radiation (x-ray, gamma ray, beta particle, neutron) may cause ionization in DNA or other biological significant molecule. The energy of ionizing radiation (x-ray, gamma ray, beta particle, neutron) is far greater than the energy required to break bonds in organic molecules. The extent of this interaction (DIRECT EFFECT) occurring depends on the number of particular molecules in the cell, and the size of the molecule.\\

Depending how a molecule is damaged, different results may occur (death of the cell, change in the production of an essential enzyme or protein, cause uncontrolled reproduction of the cell into many cells, damage is repaired by the cell, etc.). Both direct and indirect effects contribute to the overall number of such damaging events to the DNA and will vary for individual cell types.\\

The basic assumption in radiation protection is that the harmful effects of ionizing radiation are related to the absorbed dose.  One of the questions that is often asked is whether the effect of low-level ionizing radiation is cumulative or whether it is harmful only if it exceeds some threshold value.  Most of the evidence indicates that there are effects of both kinds.  Some effects, such as cataracts, do not occur below a certain threshold level of radiation. Other effects, such as the onset of cancer, do not appear to have any threshold and the risk of inducing such an effect increases with increasing dose.\\

Radiosensitivity is the relative susceptibility of cells, tissues, organs, organisms, or other substances to the injurious action of radiation. In general, it has been found that cell radiosensitivity is directly proportional to the rate of cell division and inversely proportional to the degree of cell differentiation. In short, this means that actively dividing cells or those not fully mature are most at risk from radiation. The most radio-sensitive cells are those which (1) have a high rate of division, (2) have a high metabolic rate, (3) are of a non-specialized type, and (4) are well nourished.  Table \ref{tbl:rsRadiosensitivity} gives examples of cells with low and high susceptibilities to radiation. \\

\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Working Safely with Radioactive Substances}}

{\bf Time, Distance, and Shielding} are the three basic radiation protection principles that MUST be used to minimize external radiation exposures, however prior to using these three principles you need to know the specifics of the radioactive source you are using, including activity, type of emissions, and the energies involved.\\

{\bf Identification} -- Knowing the type and energy of the emitter will determine the appropriate type of shielding, the assay method, and technological methods required to safely handle the material. \\

{\bf Time} -- Radiation doses are directly proportional to the time spent in the radiation field. The workers dose is halved, when the time spent in a given radiation field is halved.  Therefore, preplan the procedures to reduce the time in an exposure field. Develop a detailed plan for carrying out the steps before beginning any new procedures. Complete as much preparation work as possible before incorporating any radioactive materials are into the experimental procedures. Practice the techniques required for the procedure to reduce the time of exposure. Prior to beginning the procedure organize and have readily available all the necessary materials, tools, and equipment. \\

{\bf Distance} -- Radiation doses are inversely proportional to the distance squared (inverse square law). Increasing the distance from a radiation source will reduce the amount of exposure received. Remote handling devices (forceps, tongs, or tweezers) can greatly reduce the exposure to hands or extremities. Do not work directly over open containers of radioactive materials. \\

{\bf Shielding} -- Radiation doses can be greatly reduced by the use of the appropriate type of shields. Store and work with high-energy beta emitters behind Lucite shielding. Keep gamma emitters behind lead shielding. Ensure that all surfaces of the shielding containers (top, bottom, front, back, \& sides) are appropriate. Do not assume that the floor or a wall is adequate shielding. Personnel working in adjacent spaces may receive unnecessary and/or unmonitored exposures due to inadequate or lack of shielding. Radioactive material and samples when not in use shall be returned to appropriate shielded storage areas. Wear plastic safety eye wear to protect the cornea of your eye from beta radiation. \\

Radioactive material located inside the body may result in an internal radiation dose. Internal doses are hazardous and more difficult to detect and quantify than external doses. Therefore, significant emphasis is placed upon preventing the internalization of contamination. \\

{\bf Radioactive contamination} refers to the presence of radioactive material in areas or on surfaces where it is not desired. Radioactive contamination is actual physical material that typically cannot be seen, but can be transferred from one surface to another through contact. Radioactive contamination can be airborne, or deposited directly on surfaces.  It is essential to remove gloves and laboratory coats when leaving the laboratory. {\bf Do not use the computer keyboard, alpha spectrometer, or other devices while wearing gloves that were used for the preparation of the radioactive sources}.  \\

Four potential routes of intake include absorption, ingestion, inhalation, and wounds. Absorption takes place when direct skin contact is made with a contaminated surface or when skin is exposed to airborne contamination. The primary means of inhalation is through the use of volatile substances outside of the fumehood. Ingestion is the accidental consumption of contaminated food or liquids.  The accidental injection of radioactive materials with needles or sharps is remotely possible.  Absorption is the most common route of intake in a research or University setting.\\

\noindent
{\bf When working with radioactive materials, always:}
%\vspace{-2cm}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Define and label the work area. 
\item Label equipment. 
\item Use personal protective equipment. 
\item Perform a dry run. 
\item Perform procedure using good work practices. 
\item Use appropriate housekeeping practices.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage

\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Reportable Incidents}}

\noindent
{\bf The following require IMMEDIATE reporting to Campus Security and Radiation Safety at anytime.}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item A spill of radioactive material (outside of the radioactive work area)
\item Personal contamination (including clothing)
\item Known or suspected internal contamination
\item Known or suspected external exposure where person(s) may have received a dose in excess of 3 mSv (300 mRem) 
\item Widespread contamination
\item Loss or theft of any quantity of nuclear substance (radioactive material)
\item A release of a quantity of radioactive nuclear substance into the environment not authorized by Licensed activity
\item An attempted or actual breach of security or sabotage at the site of the licensed activity
\item A serious illness or injury incurred or possibly incurred as a result of the licensed activity
\item The death of any person at a nuclear facility as a result of licensed activity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Emergency Response to a Radioactive Spill}}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Notify all occupants in the area about the spill, if contaminate is volatile evacuate the area immediately.
\item Secure the area, keep all individuals from entering.
\item Ensure prompt first aid treatment is administered for injured personnel.
\item Remove all contaminated clothing and place in a plastic bag. Attempts must be made to remove all external contamination as soon as possible. Flush the area for a minimum of 15 minutes, if contamination is splashed in the eyes, mouth, or on skin.
\item Report the spill to Campus Security (403 220-5333) or Environmental Health \& Safety (403-220-6345) immediately.
\item Contain large volumes of non-volatile liquid spills to prevent further spreading. Ensure proper personal protective equipment is being worn.
\item Remain in the area to provide information and assistance in the clean up.
\item Ensure that all spilled and contaminated materials are properly packaged for disposal and are treated as hazardous wastes. Ensure that all other items in the clean up are decontaminated.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection{\LARGE{\bf Specific Procedures for Managing Personal Contamination}}
Immediate corrective actions should be taken if you know or suspect that you may have radioactive contamination on your clothing or skin. Prompt actions will minimize your exposure and will prevent a further spread of contamination. The primary concern regarding contamination on the clothing or skin is the increased probability of intake and resultant internal radiation exposure. Remember, radioactivity can enter the body by way of inhalation, ingestion, absorption, or through breaks in the skin.

\subsection{\bf Guidelines for contaminated wounds}

Minor wounds (puncture, scrape, and cut) while working with radioactivity require IMMEDIATE actions to limit any possible internal radiation exposure. Since minor wounds typically involve the hands, the following guideline is written for this situation.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Remove your gloves; turn them inside out, and DO NOT dispose.
\item Save the gloves and the object that caused the wound for monitoring and isotope identification. Information obtained from these items may help determine whether an internal exposure is likely.
\item Allow the wound to bleed and flush it gently with clean water. This will remove any radioactivity present in the wound and may prevent its absorption into the body.
\item Bandage or cover the wound, and seek medical attention if required.
\item Contact Campus Security (403-220-5333) or Environmental Health \& Safety (403-220-6345) immediately.
\end{itemize}

{\bf NOTE:} For serious injuries or illnesses, always seek prompt medical attention first. Treatment and safety of the seriously injured person(s) ALWAYS takes precedence over radioactive contamination control. Emergency Services will only treat decontaminated individuals.

\subsection{\bf Guidelines for Contaminated Clothing}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Put on and wear a clean pair of gloves to carefully remove all contaminated clothing in such a way as to prevent a further spread of contamination, especially to the skin. Remove clothing inside out to contain the contamination.
\item Seal the contaminated clothing in a plastic bag. Write the following information on the bag: Name, telephone number of the owner of the clothing, and the radioisotopes involved.
\item After removal of contaminated clothing, carefully monitor all exposed skin areas. Monitor your hands. Follow the guidelines below if skin contamination is detected.
\item Contact Environmental Health \& Safety (403-220-6345) for cleaning of contaminated clothing. The clothing will most likely be stored until the radioactivity has decayed, if the clothing cannot be cleaned and the isotopes involved are short-lived.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\bf Guidelines for Personal Contaminations}
Contamination deposited directly on the skin can cause intense irradiation of the skin as well as substantially increasing the risk for intake into the body.
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Use mild hand soap or other appropriate solution for use on the skin. Some decontamination solutions and cleansers contain harsh chemicals and are not intended for use on the skin.
\item Water used for skin decontamination should be lukewarm in temperature. Water that is too hot or too cold will increase the blood flow to the area and increase the absorption of the contamination.
\item Gently wash or scrub the affected skin areas for about 2 to 3 minutes. Pay special attention to the fingernails if the hands are contaminated
\item Rinse with clean water and gently pat dry. Re-monitor the area with a contamination monitor.
Repeat this procedure as necessary, RUB DO NOT SCRUB.
\item NOTE: Gloves should be worn to prevent the spread of radioactive contamination to the hands during decontamination operations.
\item Work from the center of your body out (if your forearm is contaminated wash from the elbow towards the hand, hold your arm such that the water runs off your arm into the sink, not onto the floor or your body).
\item Monitor affected skin areas after every decontamination; attempt to determine effectiveness.
\item Stop cleaning immediately if contamination cannot be removed, or if the skin becomes irritated.
\item Rinse your eyes in an eyewash station for at least 15 minutes to flush foreign material out.
\item Rinse your mouth with water, but DO NOT swallow.
\item Blow your nose and keep the tissue, it will be analyzed for radioactive contamination. The nose filters approximately 50\% of particulate matter.
\item Have someone absorb surface liquids, and liquids in the outer ear, lean to the side which has the liquid in it. Do not stick anything in your ear.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\bf Procedures for Decontamination of Equipment and Areas}

Tools, equipment, and work areas must be free of radioactive contamination whenever possible. All users are responsible for conducting surveys and promptly decontaminating all items and surfaces, if required.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Always wear protective clothing during decontamination operations. Minimum requirements include wearing a labcoat and two pairs of gloves (triple gloving is highly recommended).
\item There are several products commercially available for decontamination. Alternatively, two tablespoons of Alconox or Sparkleen can be dissolved in water to make a paste.
\item Methods used in decontamination include washing, scrubbing, abrasion, and corrosive methods. Always start with washing before progressing to more difficult decontamination methods.
\item DO NOT use methods such as grinding, sanding, scraping or chipping contaminated surfaces without the specific direction of Environmental Health \& Safety.
\item Complex items should be disassembled as much as possible to allow sufficient cleaning of inner surfaces which may be contaminated. Do not disassemble if such action will jeopardize the operational integrity of the item or equipment.
\item Use disposable materials, such as paper towels.
\item Minimize the spread of contamination during decontamination operations. Avoid wiping a highly contaminated cleaning towel over a less contaminated surface. Generally, the best technique is to start at the edge of a contaminated area and work toward the area of highest contamination. The exception to this, however, would be to clean highly contaminated areas first if those areas were creating unacceptably high radiation exposure levels.
\item Frequently monitor surfaces during decontamination with either portable survey instruments or swipe tests to determine the effectiveness of the procedures being used. Continue decontamination as necessary.
\item Conduct SWIPE TESTS to confirm that there is no removable contamination.
\item Items and surfaces which cannot be successfully decontaminated must be identified and controlled as radioactive material. Such areas may also require shielding.
\item Ensure that all radioactive waste generated during decontamination is properly collected and disposed into the solid and liquid waste containers.
\end{itemize}

\section{\LARGE{\bf II. Safety information for Specific Experiments in Physics 325}}

{\bf When working in any laboratory, no food or drink should be stored or consumed.  Wash your hands after handling any radioactive material before leaving the laboratory.}

\subsection{\bf Rutherford Scattering}

The Rutherford scattering experiment uses sealed sources to calibrate the alpha spectrometer. Sealed sources contain radioactive isotopes that are sealed in metal or plastic and these sources may be handled without specific safety equipment.  Nevertheless, exposure to any radioactive substance should be minimized.  In this experiment, the sealed sources are contained within the bell jar and you will not handle the sources at all.  Alpha particles from the decay of $^{241}$Am are incident on a gold target.  The americium source is enclosed in the bell jar and you will not have to handle this source at all.  

\subsection{\bf Compton Scattering}

The 35 milliCurie $^{137}$Cesium source used in the Compton scattering apparatus is dangerous.  The basic rule to follow is avoid the gamma ray beam. Do NOT put any part of the body (notably hands and heads) in the path of the gamma ray beam. Stay completely out of the white painted area at all times when the gamma ray beam aperture is open. Handle the gamma ray stopper plug only by the extremities (the rings). Move the gamma ray detector assembly only by the magnets or the black knobs that are out of the white painted area. When changing the target rod, always close the gamma ray beam aperture first. Do NOT leave the apparatus unattended if the stopper is removed. Caution anyone entering the Compton scattering experiment area when the gamma ray beam aperture is open. Always plug the gamma ray beam aperture with the stopper when the experiment is completed.
Sealed sources are used to calibrate the gamma spectrometer. Sealed sources contain radioactive isotopes that are sealed in metal or plastic and  these sources may be handled without specific safety equipment.  Nevertheless, exposure to any radioactive substance should be minimized.  Once the calibration of the detector is complete, return the source to the storage container immediately.  

\subsection{\bf Radioactive Decay}

The radioactive decay experiment uses indium metal that is activated by a flux of neutrons.  The indium metal becomes radioactive and decays by beta-minus decay to an isotope of tin.  This isotope has been chosen because it is a weak, short half-life beta emitter with low chemical activity so it is not dangerous. Your TA will expose the indium metal to the neutron flux and you will not have to work with the neutron source in this experiment.  However, there are some precautions when handling the indium metal.  Do not touch the indium with your fingers or drop it on the floor. Handle the indium only with tweezers.

\newpage
\subsection{\bf Nuclear Decay}

This experiment requires special precautions because the radioactive sample is not sealed:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Wear latex gloves, a laboratory coat, and goggles at all times.
\item Do not operate the equipment (computer, alpha spectrometer, etc.) while wearing gloves.  Only touch the instruments with clean hands to avoid spreading radioactive contamination. 
\item Perform all operations inside the plastic trays.
\item Do not let the stirring rod touch anything except the inside of the beaker.
\item Do not let the eye droppers touch anything except their own sample bottle.
\item Mouth pipetting is forbidden.
\item Rinse the beaker, graduated cylinder, and stirring rod with distilled water after use.
\item Put all disposable solids into the solid radioactive waste beaker.
\item Put all left over liquid from rinsing and filtering in the liquid radioactive waste bottle. 
\item Do not touch the surface of the sample with anything.
\end{itemize}
You will have to filter your sample prior to analysis with the alpha spectrometer.  At this point, it is important to do a "test run" to make sure that the filter apparatus is not leaking before you pass the radioactive solution through the filter paper.  To test the operation of the filter, set up the filter funnel and check that nothing leaks around the sides by pouring in some distilled water. Usually, if there is a leak, it is because the filter paper is not properly centered over the screen. Once it is ready, then pour the contents of the beaker into the funnel. \\

Once prepared, the sample disc should only be touched with tweezers.  Do not touch the radioactive source with hands (whether wearing gloves or not). Rinse the beaker, graduated cylinder, and stirring rod with some distilled water after the sample preparation is completed. The rinse water and the filtered liquid must both be poured into the liquid radioactive waste bottle. \\

Sealed sources are used to calibrate the alpha spectrometer. These sources contain radioactive isotopes that are sealed in metal or plastic and these sources may be handled without specific safety equipment.  Nevertheless, exposure to any radioactive substance should be minimized.  Once the calibration of the detector is complete, return the source to the 
storage container immediately.\\

\subsection{{\bf Activation of Material (Indium) by Slow Neutrons (n,$\gamma$)}}

Slow and thermal neutrons interact with indium to produce excited states. Natural-abundance indium has two stable isotopes, $^{113}$In (4.2\%) and $^{115}$In (95.8\%). The neutron-capture reactions are:

\begin{equation}
^{113}In \to \begin{cases} ^{114}In*\ \ \ \ \ ;\ \ \ \ \ \sigma = 8\ barns \ \ \ T^{1/2} = 50\ days \\ 
^{114}In\ \ \ \ \ \ \ ;\ \ \ \ \ \sigma = 4\ barns \ \ \ T^{1/2} = 72\ sec \\ 
\end{cases}

^{116}In\ \ \ \ \ \ ;\ \ \ \ \ \sigma = 40\ barns \ \ \ T^{1/2} = 14.1\ sec \\ 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Data on capture cross sections are available online.  Because of the higher isotopic abundance of $^{115}$In, and its larger cross section, the predominant radioactive isotope formed is $^{116}$In and isomeric states. $^{116}$In and $^{116}$In* decay via $\beta$ decay into stable $^{116}$Sn according to:

\begin{equation}
^{116}In \to ^{116}Sn + e^{-} + \overset{-}{\nu}_{e}.
\end{equation}

While the decay from the $^{116}$In ground state (1+) proceeds directly into the $^{116}$Sn ground state (0+), the isomeric states decay into excited states of $^{116}$Sn. Several $\gamma$ rays are emitted in their de-excitation.

Simplified decay schemes for indium isotopes.

When a very thin sample is irradiated, the rate of activation is directly proportional to the neutron flux. Thick samples perturb the neutron flux and depress the rate of activation. While any sample is being activated, it is also decaying. Thus we have two competing processes that determine the absolute value of the radioactivity of the sample at any point in time. The rate of activation is given by:

\begin{equation}
R=\sigma \phi\ N_{t}\ (for\ thin\ samples),
\end{equation}

Where $\Phi$ = average neutron flux, $\sigma$ = activation cross section, and Nt = number of target nuclei. The rate of decay is given by $\lambda$N, where $\lambda$ = $\frac{1}{\tau}$ = the decay constant, and N = the total number of radioactive nuclei present. The rate of change in N is the difference between the rate of activation and the rate of decay:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt} = R -\lambda N
\end{equation}

A detailed discussion of the rates of activation and decay will be found in Reference (1), p. 765 - 771, and Reference (2) Chapter 19. \\

\section{Preparation}
Carefully read the theory section of this lab write-up to ensure that you understand how light emitting diodes (LEDs) are being used to determine Planck's constant as well as the difficulties that arise in doing so.  You may find it useful to read about photon energy quantization in your textbook as well as review the function of semi-conductor doping.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}
Many undergraduate labs make use of LEDs to estimate, through non-spectroscopic means, a value for Planck's constant. The method usually employed makes assumptions about the relationship between an LED's built-in voltage and its band gap voltage. This lab will explore these assumptions and illustrate the inherent problems that arise if they are not valid. Additionally, this lab will develop an understanding of LEDs under both forward and reverse bias conditions.


\section{Theory}

In the nuclear theory of single atoms, the electrons surrounding the nucleus are organized into 
different energy levels (shells). Quantum mechanics predicts that the energy levels of these 
electrons can only have certain discrete values. However, a solid piece of material contains a 
large number of atoms bound together. As atoms are squeezed together, the energy levels from 
electrons in adjacent atoms overlap with each other. The inner low energy electrons close to the 
nucleus have energy levels that are almost unaffected. However, the energy levels of the outermost
or \textbf{valence electrons} spread out into continuous bands. Depending on how close the atoms are 
squeezed, these bands may even start to overlap. The \textbf{valence band} is the band of energies 
that the valence electrons occupy. The next empty band outward is called the \textbf{conduction band}
. The difference in energy between the valence and conduction bands is called the \textbf{band gap}. 
If an electron gains enough energy to move to the conduction band it becomes free to move around. 

If the material is an \textbf{insulator} the valence band is completely full, the conduction band is empty
and the band gap between these two energy bands is large. The electrons require a large amount of energy
before they can be promoted to the conduction band. For this reason insulators are poor conductors.
On the other hand, if the valence band is only partly filled (the valence band and the conduction 
band are equivalent), or if a full valence band overlaps the empty conduction band because of tight
atomic packing the material is a \textbf{conductor}. Electrons easily become mobile in conductors. When
the valence bands and conduction bands do not overlap but are quite close together the material is a 
\textbf{semiconductor}. Here even a small amount of extra energy is enough to promote some electrons to
the conduction band. Such energy can be provided by the temperature of the material alone. At very low
temperatures semiconductors are insulators. As the temperature increases the number of conduction
electrons increases rapidly. At high temperatures semiconductors behave like conductors.

The above description holds true for pure materials where all the atoms are of the same 
element. The picture changes when impurities are added. This is especially true for semiconductors.
Remember that a semiconductor has a partially filled valence band. If impurities are added that 
have enough electrons to fill the valence band \textbf{plus} one more electron, then the remaining free
electron is basically in the conduction band.  An \textbf{electron} free in this way is called a 
\textbf{donor}. Such a material is called an \textbf{n-type semiconductor}. Similarly, if an impurity 
is added that will fill the valence band to capacity \textbf{minus} one electron then the remaining 
absence of an electron is very likely to attract electrons to it. A missing electron, or \textbf{hole},
made in this way is called an \textbf{acceptor} and such a material is called a 
\textbf{p-type semiconductor}. In n-type semiconductors the charge carriers are the electrons. In 
p-type semiconductors the charge carriers are the holes. The holes move through the material in the 
same way as a bubble flows through a fluid. Tuning the properties of a semiconductor by adding donor or
acceptor materials is called \textbf{doping}.

\caption{Equilibrium situation for a diode}
\label{fig:PC1}
\end{marginfigure}

The basic building block of all modern electronics is constructed by joining together an 
n-type semiconductor and a p-type semiconductor to form a \textbf{pn junction}. The device made from 
such a single pn junction is called a \textbf{diode}. In a pn junction at equilibrium, holes from the 
p side tend to drift towards the n side while free electrons from the n side drift in the other 
direction. At the junction these drifting electrons and holes recombine. This drift current causes the
n side of the junction to acquire a net positive charge because some of the excess electrons have 
drifted away. Similarly, the p side will get a net negative charge because some of the excess holes 
have drifted away. The difference in charges shifts the energies of the valence and conduction bands on
both sides of the junction. This equilibrium situation for a diode is shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:PC1}. Notice that electrons in the conduction band on the n side of the junction 
cannot easily move to the p side because the conduction band there now has higher energy.

When a voltage is applied to the diode so that the p side is made more positive and the n side more 
negative, the diode is said to be \textbf{forward biased}. When a diode is forward biased, the 
difference between energy levels on the p and n sides of the junction is decreased. It is now easier 
for free electrons to cross from the n side to the p side. The energy level diagram for a forward 
biased diode is shown in Figure \ref{fig:PC2}. When a diode is \textbf{reverse biased} the p 
side is made more negative. Now the difference in energy levels is increased which makes it even harder
for electrons to cross the junction. What this means is that the conduction of a diode changes with the
voltage across it. At large forward voltages the diode is a very good conductor while at large reverse
voltages the diode is a very poor conductor. Contrast this behaviour with that of a simple conductor. A
piece of metal is a very good conductor no matter what voltage is applied to it and an insulator is a 
very poor conductor no matter what voltage is applied to it. 

The equation for the current, I, flowing in a diode is given by

\begin{equation}
I=I_0(e^{\frac{ev}{kT}}-1),
\label{equ:PC1}
\end{equation}
where I$_{0}$ is a constant characteristic of the diode, e is the electron charge, k is Boltzmann's 
constant, T is the absolute temperature, and V is the voltage applied to the diode. At room 
temperature this becomes

\begin{equation}
I=I_0e^{38.6V},
\label{equ:PC2}
\end{equation}
Since usually I$_0$ is very small.

\end{marginfigure}

The movement of holes in the diode is also affected by the voltage applied to the diode with the 
difference that the holes move in the other direction. An electron that gains enough energy from the
applied voltage to cross the junction is called an \textbf{excited electron}. Occasionally an excited 
electron will jump into a hole instead of flowing to the voltage source. This process is called 
\textbf{recombination}.  When an excited electron recombines with a hole the excess energy of the 
electron is carried away by a photon. In normal diodes the probability of recombination is very small.
This happens because the mobility of the holes is very different from that of the electrons. Special 
materials can be used to tune the mobility of the electrons and holes so that the probability of 
recombination is very high. A diode designed to emit photons in this way is called a \textbf{light 
emitting diode} or \textbf{LED}. The energy of the emitted photon is directly dependent on the size of
the band gap. Furthermore, Planck's constant determines the wavelength of photons with given energy. 
Hence the wave length of light emitted by the LED is determined by the band gap and Planck's constant. 
These quantities are related by the equation

\begin{equation}
\lambda={\frac{hc}{E_{BG}}},
\label{equ:PC3}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon, h is Planck's constant, c (c = 299792458 m/s) is the speed of
light and E$_{BG}$ is the energy in joules that separates the valence and conduction bands in the p-type (the band
gap). Knowing the relation for the wavelength of light with respect to its frequency and rewriting  
energy as charge multiplied by potential one arrives at the formula

\begin{equation}
h={\frac{eV_{BG}}{f}},
\label{equ:PC4}
\end{equation}

%***********REVISED BY WESLEY KYLE MAY 12, 2015**********************************************
%REASON: CORRECTING INACCURATE INFORMATION AND PROVIDING BETTER EXPLANATION OF ASSUMPTIONS

where f is the frequency of the photon and eV$_{BG}$ is the potential difference across the band gap, from the p-side conduction band to the p-side valence band. The voltage measured across the LED when it just begins to shine is often called the \textit{turn-on voltage}. This voltage approximates the \textit{built-in voltage}, V$_0$, of an LED. The built-in voltage is the energy that is required to move an electron across the pn junction to the p side (see Figure \ref{fig:PC3}). Once it is there, the electron is free to undergo recombination with a hole and produce a photon with an energy equal to that of the band gap. To be clear, there is no direct, intrinsic connection between these two energies. Their relationship depends on the material used as a semi-conductor, the doping material and extent of doping, as well as the design of the LED (e.g., direct or indirect band gap). The amount they differ by, $\Delta E$, will vary across different LEDs. 

%This experiment nevertheless treats $\Delta E$ to be constant. When using Equation \ref{equ:PC3} to determine Planck's constant this assumption is equivalent to treating 

So it is not reasonable to assume that measurements of the built-in voltage are the same as the band gap voltage. It may still be possible, however, to measure Planck's constant using Equation \ref{equ:PC3}. The only assumption required is that $\Delta E$ be constant across each LED. This might be achieved by selecting LEDs with the same design and construction materials.

To illustrate this, one can look at what happens to the equivalence relation between V$_{BG}$ and V$_0$ if one says that the energy of the band gap is equal to the built-in voltage plus some difference, $\Delta E$,

\begin{equation}
eV_{BG}=h\nu=\dfrac{hc}{\lambda}=eV_{0}+\Delta E
\label{equ:PC5}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
eV_{0}=hc\dfrac{1}{\lambda}-\Delta E
\label{equ:PC6}
\end{equation}

What is seen here is the equation of a straight line where, if the built-in voltage can be determined and the frequency of each LED is known, Planck's constant can be determined from the slope of a fitted linear curve. It is known from Equation \ref{equ:PC6} that a consistent difference between the built-in voltage and the band gap voltage does not affect our ability to determine Planck's constant. Instead, the difference manifests itself as a non-zero y-intercept. Thus, the only necessary assumption to equate V$_{BG}$ and V$_0$ (that is, set $\Delta E=0$) is that the energy difference be the same for each LED.

By measuring the built-in voltage of a set of LEDs and comparing them to the spectroscopically determined band gap voltages by finding $\Delta E$ the validity of this assumption may be put to the test.

\section{Apparatus}

A display board is provided for you that holds an assortment of 8 LEDs ranging in wavelength from the infra-red at 859 nm to the blue at 475 nm.  The Anatek power supply is connected to the \textbf{bias voltage} connection that powers each LED. An ammeter is connected in series with the rest of the circuit to measure the current through the LED and a voltmeter is connected in parallel with the power supply to measure the bias voltage.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Apply a forward bias of 10 V to each LED and check the ammeter to ensure a current is passing through the LEDs (see Figure \ref{fig:PC4} for a circuit diagram and wiring instructions). If any are found to be not functioning, inform your TA.
\item To explore the current-voltage behaviour of an LED through an I-V plot select an LED and apply a forward bias of 0 to 7 V in increments of 0.2 V and record at least 30 measurements of the current through the LED at each bias voltage.
\item With each of the remaining 7 LEDs, collect at least 10 measurements of current for bias voltages between 3 and 7 volts. These measurements are started above 3 V to ensure that the bias voltage is greater than the built-in voltage of each LED and will be used to estimate the built-in voltage of each LED.
\item To explore the reverse biased behaviour of an LED select an LED and apply a reverse bias of 0 to 5 V in increments of 0.5 V and record at least 10 measurements of the current through the LED at each bias voltage.
\end{enumerate}




\section{Error Analysis}

Take the wavelength of each LED to be exact as given. These values have been determined spectroscopically and will be used to find the true band-gap voltage of each LED. The uncertainty in readings of voltage and current with the Fluke multimeter is the instrument error as shown on the bottom of the instrument. Its format is given as a percentage of the readout value plus the last digit of the readout. For example, a reading of $3.45$ VDC might have an uncertainty of $\pm (0.3\%+1$ digit$)$. This yields an uncertainty of $\pm (3.45\times.003+0.01)$. We then record our observation as $3.45$ V $\pm\ 0.02$.

\section{Preparation}

The student should review the theory of Fermi-Dirac and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

The purpose of this experiment is to examine the current-voltage characteristics of an electron tube, to determine the barrier energy and the work function of tungsten using Maxwell-Boltzmann and Fermi-Dirac statistics, respectively, to examine the space charge region using the Child-Langmuir three halves power law, and to make a Richardson plot of thermionic emission.  

\section{Theory}

In the late nineteenth century it was discovered that hot metals emitted charged particles. This process is now known as \textbf{thermionic emission}. Thomas Edison discovered thermionic emission as he looked for ways to keep soot from clouding his incandescent light bulbs. To collect some of the material responsible for the soot, Edison placed a metal plate a small distance from the filament. When this metal plate was connected to the positive terminal of the battery, he was able to measure a small 
electrical current across the gap. He could not observe any current when the plate was connected to the negative terminal of the battery.  Edison concluded that the plate 
was collecting negative charge, but could not explain exactly why. Because it did not eliminate the soot problem, he did little with this discovery.  

The physicist J.J. Thomson followed up on Edison's work. He performed measurements on the electric and magnetic deflections of the particles given off by the filament. 
Thomson found the same value for the charge to mass ratio of the particles originating from the filament as he had with previous experiments with \textbf{cathode rays}. 
Later researchers were able to devise methods to control this emission, which started the science of electronics. It would not be wrong to assert that the birth of 
electronics started with the discovery that the filament in Edison's light bulb emitted electrons.

In this experiment the thermionic emission of electrons from the hot tungsten filament of an \textbf{electron tube} is investigated. The emitter of the electrons is known as
the \textbf{filament} or \textbf{cathode}. The collector receiving the electrons is the \textbf{plate} or \textbf{anode}. Figure \ref{fig:egElectronTube} illustrates a typical electron tube. 
Thermionic emission is observed by examining the electric current between the cathode and anode. Any gases in the tube will interfere with the electrons, so an evacuated 
tube is used. Therefore, it is necessary to study the separate but related phenomenon of \textbf{electric current flow} in a vacuum. It turns out that the atomic properties
of the cathode material determines the behaviour of the electrons in the gap. 

From experimental results, physicists have established that the  \textbf{valence electrons}, usually one per atom in a metal, are essentially free to move throughout the 
metal. For this reason a metal can be considered a "gas" of free electrons surrounding a regular arrangement of positive ions which form a crystal lattice. This  
\textbf{electron gas} is the source of thermionic emission in a metal. The inter-atomic forces between the crystal lattice of ions and the electron gas constitute the so 
called metallic bonds.  

At the metal boundary there exists a potential barrier which keeps most of the electrons confined inside the metal. As an approximation for electrons inside a metal, one can
consider the electrons to be confined in a box where they collide elastically with the walls of the box bouncing back and forth between them. Electrons do not interact with
each other except through elastic collisions like in an ideal gas. The electron gas model holds when the metal is pure, free of imperfections, and when lattice vibrations 
can be ignored. 

The energy distribution of the electrons in the metal determines their emission from the surface of the metal when it is hot. In order to compute the electron energy 
distribution, the number of electrons, N(E), having some energy, E, needs to be calculated. At any constant temperature, T, this is given by the expression

\begin{equation}
N(E)=g(E)f(E),
\label{equ:egNumberOfElectrons}
\end{equation}
where \textbf{g(E)} is the \textbf{density of states function} and \textbf{f(E)} is the \textbf{statistical distribution function}. The density of states function is the 
number of energy states available to electrons with energy between E and E + $\Delta$E. The statistical distribution function is the probability that a particle will occupy a state
of energy E.

\caption{Standing waves in an infinite potential well}
\label{fig:egStandingWaves}
\end{marginfigure}

It seems easiest to begin by examining a \textbf{one dimensional metal}.  The density of states function can be found in a one dimensional metal in the following way. 
Suppose the electrons are confined in a one dimensional box of length L. The box can be viewed as a one dimensional potential well with an infinite potential barrier, as 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:egStandingWaves}.  In a quantum mechanical description the electrons have wave properties associated with them. Because the electrons collide with the walls of the box, the
quantum states of the electrons must consist of standing waves for which a node occurs at each wall. The path length from wall to wall must be an integral number, s, of half
wavelengths so that    

\begin{equation}
L=\frac{s\lambda}{2},
\label{equ:egPathLength}\ \ \ \text{s = 0,1,2,...}
\end{equation}
 As the wavelength, {$\lambda$}, of the standing wave decreases, the energy of the electron increases.


According to de Broglie, an electron with a wavelength, {$\lambda$}, has momentum, p, given by 

\begin{equation}
p=\frac{h}{\lambda},
\label{equ:egMomentumAndWaveLength}
\end{equation}
where h is Planck's constant (h=4.136x10$^{-15}$eV$\cdot{s}$ or 6.626x10$^{-34}$J$\cdot{s}$). Since the electrons in the metal have non relativistic velocities their 
momentum is then

\begin{equation}
p=\sqrt{2mE}.
\label{equ:egMomentumAndEnergy}
\end{equation}

Substituting Equations \ref{equ:egMomentumAndWaveLength} and \ref{equ:egMomentumAndEnergy} into Equation \ref{equ:egPathLength} gives

\begin{equation}
s=\frac{2L}{\lambda}=\frac{2Lp}{h}=\frac{2L\sqrt{2mE}}{h}.
\label{equ:egEnergyOfState}
\end{equation}
Taking the derivative of Equation \ref{equ:egEnergyOfState} with respect to energy gives a relationship between {$\Delta$}s and {$\Delta$}E which is

\begin{equation}
{\Delta}s=\frac{L}{h}\sqrt{\frac{2m}{E}}{\Delta}E.
\label{equ:egdStateAnddEnegrgy}
\end{equation}

Each standing wave can represent two states of an electron, one with spin up and one with spin down. So Equation \ref{equ:egdStateAnddEnegrgy} is doubled to get the density of
states which is

\begin{equation}
g(E){\Delta}E=2{\Delta}s=\frac{2L}{h}\sqrt{\frac{2m}{E}}{\Delta}E.
\label{equ:egDensityOfState1}
\end{equation}

Consider an example of N electrons in the box at temperature T = $0$ K. According to the \textbf{Pauli exclusion principle}, which states that no more than two fermions can 
occupy one and the same energy state, the electrons will fill the lowest possible energy states, one electron per state, starting with E = $0$ to the state with the highest energy E = {$\varepsilon$}$_{F}$ called the \textbf{Fermi level}. The difference in energy between the ground state and the Fermi level is called the {\bf Fermi energy}. The number of electrons in this situation will be equal to the number of states with energies between zero 
and {$\varepsilon$}$_{F}$ so that

\begin{equation}
N=\int_0^{\varepsilon_F}g(E)\,dE = \int_0^{\varepsilon_F}\frac{2L}{h}\sqrt{\frac{2m}{E}}\,dE = \frac{4L}{h}\sqrt{2m\varepsilon_F}.
\label{equ:egNumberAtFermi}
\end{equation}
The Fermi energy to be calculated in terms of the number of electrons in the potential well is

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_F = \frac{N^2 h^2}{32 m L^2}.
\label{equ:egFermiEnergy}
\end{equation}
The density of state for this example can be found by isolating L/h from Equation \ref{equ:egFermiEnergy} and then substituting the result into Equation \ref{equ:egDensityOfState1}.

\begin{equation}
g(E){\Delta}E=\frac{1}{2}\frac{N}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_F E}}\Delta E.
\label{equ:egDensityOfState2}
\end{equation}

Analogous calculations for a three dimensional potential well of side L are found in a similar manner as for the one dimensional case except that spherical shells are used 
instead of strips. The density of states for the three dimensional case turns out to be


\begin{equation}
g(E){\Delta}E=\frac{8\sqrt{2} \pi L^3 m^{3/2}}{h^3}\sqrt{E} \Delta E.
\label{equ:egDensityOfState3D}
\end{equation}

Up to this point, the density of states of the electrons in a metal in which the electrons have energies between E and E + {$\Delta$}E has been examined. The number of 
electrons in a metal having these energies has only been calculated for the special one dimensional case at T = $0$ K. To find this number for a real three dimensional metal 
at any temperature the statistical distribution function f(E) relevant to the electrons is required.

If electrons in the three dimensional box were treated as distinguishable, non-interacting classical particles without spin, colliding elastically with the walls of the box, then the 
\textbf{Maxwell-Boltzman}n distribution function would determine the electron energies. This classical distribution function has the form

\begin{equation}
f_{MB} (E)=\frac{N}{V}\left(\frac{h^2}{2 \pi mkT}\right)^{3/2}e^{\frac{-E}{kT}}
\label{equ:egMBDistribution}
\end{equation}
where N is the total number of particles, V has replaced L$^{3}$ as the volume of the three dimensional box, and k is the Boltzmann constant (k=1.38$\times10^{-23}$ J/K). When this 
distribution function was applied to the electrons in metals it was found to yield inconsistent results. 

The aforementioned inconsistencies were removed by A. Sommerfeld in 1928. He assumed the electrons were \textbf{not} classical particles and instead obeyed quantum 
mechanical \textbf{Fermi-Dirac} statistics. The Fermi-Dirac distribution function is given by

\begin{equation}
f_{FD} (E)=\frac{1}{e^{\frac{E-\varepsilon_{F}}{kT}} + 1}
\label{equ:egFDDistribution}
\end{equation}
In this approach, the electrons in a metal are treated as indistinguishable particles having spin 1/2. The functional behavior of Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and that of 
Fermi-Dirac at different temperatures are illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:egMBStatistics} through \ref{fig:egHighTemp} below.

The spin of fermions is the main cause for the differences between the two distribution functions. Figure \ref{fig:egMBStatistics} illustrates the Maxwell-Boltzmann 
distribution function for two temperatures, one near absolute zero and one at tens of thousands of degrees. When the temperature is low this distribution is very steep as 
the majority of particles are in their lowest energy state. As the temperature increases the Maxwell-Boltzmann curve flattens out because more particles have enough energy 
to exist at higher energy levels. Figure \ref{fig:egFDStatistics} shows the functional behaviour of Fermi-Dirac statistics. When temperatures are near zero, the majority of 
fermions occupy energy levels starting from zero to to E ={$\varepsilon$}$_{F}$. At high temperatures even particles in the ground state may move to higher energy levels, 
which causes the Fermi-Dirac "square" to become linear. Figure \ref{fig:egLowTemp} illustrates that the two distribution curves are very different at low temperatures. At low 
temperatures the Pauli exclusion principle causes the extreme differences between the curves.  At very high temperatures, quantum effects become small. In such a case the 
probability of finding two particles in one energy level is also small, therefore it does not matter if the particles undergo the exclusion principle. For low density and 
high temperatures the Fermi-Dirac statistics approaches that of Maxwell-Boltzmann, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:egHighTemp}.

Equation \ref{equ:egNumberOfElectrons} can now be used to calculate the number of electrons {$\Delta$}N with energies between E and E + {$\Delta$}E at some temperature T. 
According to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics this number, {$\Delta$}N$_{MB}$, would be

\begin{equation}
\Delta N_{MB}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{8\sqrt{2} \pi Vm^{\frac{3}{2}}}{h^3}\sqrt{E}\frac{N}{V}\left(\frac{h^2}{2\pi mkT}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}e^{\frac{-E}{kT}}\Delta E.
\label{equ:egNumberMB}
\end{equation}
where the factor 1/2 "removes" the spin from the electrons. While Fermi-Dirac statistics determines this number, {$\Delta$}N$_{FD}$, to be

\begin{equation}
\Delta N_{FD}=\frac{8\sqrt{2} \pi Vm^{\frac{3}{2}}}{h^3} \frac{\sqrt{E}}{e^{\frac{E-\varepsilon_F}{kT}}+1}\Delta E.
\label{equ:egNumberFD}
\end{equation}

Thermionic emission only involves the component of velocity, v$_{x}$, of electrons perpendicular to the tungsten surface of the emitting filament. Only a certain portion of
the electrons having non-zero x-component of velocity will contribute to the current out of the emitting surface.  These electrons must have sufficient velocity such that 

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}mv_{x}^2 \geq E_{B} ,
\label{equ:egMinimumEnergy}
\end{equation}
where E$_B$ is the \textbf{tungsten potential barrier}

The relationship between the energy E and the speed v of the electrons is

\begin{equation}
E=\frac{mv^2}{2}=\frac{m(v_{x}^2+v_{y}^2+v_{z}^2)}{2}.
\label{equ:egEnergyAndVelocity}
\end{equation}
and its derivative is 

\begin{equation}
{\Delta}E=mv{\Delta}v=m\sqrt{(v_{x}^2+v_{y}^2+v_{z}^2)}{\Delta}v,
\label{equ:egChangeEnergyAndVelocity}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{equ:egNumberMB} and \ref{equ:egNumberFD} can be rewritten with the velocity and this gives the number of electrons {$\Delta$}N whose speeds are between v and v +
{$\Delta$}v.  Making the required substitutions gives

\begin{equation}
{\Delta}N_{MB}=4{\pi}N\left(\frac{m}{2{\pi}kT}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}e^{\frac{-mv^2}{2kT}}v^{2}{\Delta}v,
\label{equ:egNumberMB2}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
{\Delta}N_{FD}=\frac{8{\pi}Vm^{3}}{h^3} \frac{v^2{\Delta}v}{e^{\frac{mv^2-2\varepsilon_F}{2kT}}+1}
\label{equ:egNumberFD2}
\end{equation}

To obtain the number, {$\Delta$}N$_{MB,x}$, of electrons between v$_{x}$ and v$_{x}$ + {$\Delta$}v$_{x}$ for the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, first Equation 
\ref{equ:egNumberMB2} must be changed from spherical to Cartesian coordinates.  This is done by replacing 4{$\pi$}v$^{2}$ {$\Delta$}v by 
{$\Delta$}v$_{x}${$\Delta$}v$_{y}${$\Delta$}v$_{z}$. The y and z velocity components are removed by integrating over v$_{y}$ and v$_{z}$ from +{$\infty$} to -{$\infty$}. 
The number of electrons is then

\begin{equation}
{\Delta}N_{MB,x}=nV\left(\frac{m}{2{\pi}kT}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}{\Delta}v_{x}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{\frac{-m(v_{x}^2+v_{y}^+v_{z}^2)}{2kT}}dv_{y}dv_{z}
\label{equ:egNMBx}
\end{equation}
which becomes,

\begin{equation}
{\Delta}N_{MB,x}=nV\sqrt{\frac{m}{2{\pi}kT}}e^{\frac{-mv_{x}^2}{2kT}}{\Delta}v_{x},
\label{equ:egNMBx2}
\end{equation}
where n = N/V is the concentration of electrons in tungsten. To find the emission current the number of electrons falling on the boundary per second must be calculated. To 
achieve this, first multiply Equation \ref{equ:egNMBx2} by the charge of the electron and the surface area of the metal. Then divide Equation \ref{equ:egNMBx2} by the volume V 
of the tungsten filament. Lastly, multiply by v$_{x}$ because, in some small interval of time, $\Delta t$, all the electrons with the velocity component v$_{x}$ which are contained in a layer of depth v$_{x}\Delta t$ in front of the boundary will arrive at the boundary and escape the metal. The emission current, I$_{S,MB}$, predicted assuming Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is


\begin{equation}
I_{S,MB}=aen\sqrt{\frac{m}{2{\pi}kT}}\int\limits_{\sqrt{{2E_B}/{m}}}^{+\infty}v_{x}e^{\frac{-mv_{x}^{2}}{2kT}}dv_{x}=aen\sqrt{\frac{kT}{2{\pi}m}}e^{\frac{-E_B}{kT}}
\label{equ:egEmissionCurrentMB}
\end{equation}
where a = 3.2$\times10^{-5}$m$^{2}$ is the surface area of the tungsten filament and e = 1.602$\times10^{-19}$ C is the electron charge.

The same procedure can be followed using Fermi-Dirac statistics. Starting with Equation \ref{equ:egNumberMB2} and proceeding as earlier, the emission current, I$_{S,FD}$,  
predicted by Fermi-Dirac statistics is

\begin{equation}
I_{s,FD}=2a\left(\frac{2{\pi}mek^2}{h^3}\right)T^2e^{\frac{-\phi}{kT}},
\label{equ:egEmissionCurrentFD}
\end{equation}
where {$\phi$}= E$_{B}$-{$\varepsilon$}$_{F}$ is the work function of the metal. 

Equations \ref{equ:egEmissionCurrentMB} and \ref{equ:egEmissionCurrentFD} can be rewritten in the simplified forms

\begin{equation}
I_{S,MB}=aA_{MB}T^{\frac{1}{2}}e^{\frac{-E_B}{kT}}
\label{equ:egSimpleEmissionCurrentMB}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
I_{S,FD}=2aA_{FD}T^2e^{\frac{-\phi}{kT}},
\label{equ:egRDEquation}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
A_{MB}=en\left(\frac{k}{2{\pi}m}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\label{equ:egAMB}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
A_{FD}=\frac{2{\pi}mek^2}{h^3}.
\label{equ:egAFD}
\end{equation}
Equations \ref{equ:egSimpleEmissionCurrentMB} and \ref{equ:egRDEquation} predict the maximum current, called the \textbf{saturation current}, that a metal will 
emit at a temperature T given there is no externally applied electric field on the metal. Equation \ref{equ:egRDEquation} is called the \textbf{Richardson 
Dushman equation}. It has been found that this equation predicts correctly the saturation current as a function of temperature and work function. This seems reasonable 
because electrons are fermions and hence obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. The constant A$_{FD}$, is essentially the same for all metals at room temperature.

\caption{Characteristic Curve of tungsten}
\label{fig:egCharacteristicCurve}
\end{figure}

Basically, the experiment consists of heating a tungsten filament to a known temperature, applying a known voltage between the cathode and anode, and then measuring the 
emissive current. The three variables that can be manipulated in this experiment are the temperature, voltage, and emission current. Any two of these variables can be 
plotted as a function of the other, while the third variable is held constant. The resulting curve is called a \textbf{characteristic}. Figure \ref{fig:egCharacteristicCurve}
shows three 
\textbf{current-voltage} characteristic curves.

Using the curve depicted by temperature T$_{3}$ in Figure \ref{fig:egCharacteristicCurve} as a representative, it is observed that the curve consists of three sections, the
\textbf{exponential range (ab)}, the \textbf{space charge range (bc)}, and the \textbf{temperature limited range (cd)}. It can be seen that the emission current increases at
any constant potential as the temperature increases from T$_{3}$ to T$_{1}$, The figure also illustrates that the three ranges themselves increase in size as the temperature
increases.

The application of an electric potential difference between the cathode and anode manipulates the emission current by either accelerating or retarding the motion of the 
electrons. This potential difference need not necessarily be positive in order to obtain an emission current. The exponential range is found exclusively in the region of 
negative collector potentials. Not all the electrons have enough energy to reach the collector. Many of them instead return to the filament. In this range the measured 
current consists only of the electrons that have enough energy to first overcome the potential barrier of the metal and then surmount the energy barrier produced by the 
negative applied electric potential. The Richardson Dushman equation needs to be modified in the exponential range. If the retarding voltage and the cylindrical symmetry of
the anode are taken into consideration the equation becomes

\begin{equation}
I_{E}=I_{S,FD}\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{\frac{eV}{kT}}e^{\frac{-eV}{kT}},
\label{equ:egRDExponential}
\end{equation}
where V is the negative collector potential.

%It was thought for a time that this relation supported a classical velocity distribution within the metal, because Equation 28 can be deduced from classical statistics. It 
%is known now, however, that the Fermi-Dirac distribution inside the metal degenerates to the classical form for electrons in this region as illustrated in Figure 8. 
As the potential is increased the number of electrons reaching the anode is increased. This increasing charge produced by the electrons significantly affects the emission 
current and the current-voltage characteristic is described by a power law. This marks the end of the exponential region and the beginning of the space charge region.  

In order to examine this range, the electric charge produced by the electrons themselves must be taken into account. This charge is called \textbf{space charge} and it 
occurs anytime there is a current. Not all of the electrons that are emitted have enough energy to reach the collector. For relatively small negative and positive potential
differences, many electrons leaving the filament return to it. The electrons that return to the filament form a negatively charged cloud near the filament. The cloud of
negative charge causes the electrons to initially climb a potential hill, produced by the electrons, before their journey to the collector. A precise mathematical 
description of this range is difficult. However, the empirical \textbf{Child-Langmuir 3/2 power law} agrees with experimental results well at high temperatures. In this 
law, the current is proportional to the gap voltage to the 3/2 power such that

\begin{equation}
I_{E}{\propto}V^{\frac{3}{2}}.
\label{equ:egCL3/2}
\end{equation}
As the potential between the emitter and collector increases further, more electrons reach the collector. When the potential becomes large, all the emitted electrons are 
collected by the anode and this marks the beginning of the temperature limited region. 

Temperature is the primary factor in determining the emission current in the temperature-limited range.  All the emitted electrons are forced to move to the collector by the
large applied potential. At this point further increases in gap potential should not increase the emissive current because the number of electrons are limited only by the 
work function of the metal. However, Figure \ref{fig:egCharacteristicCurve} illustrates that the temperature-limited range is not perfectly flat. The slightly positive linear
slope in this region is attributed to the lowering of the metal's potential barrier by the electric field produced by the applied emitter-collector potential. This is known
as the \textbf{Schottky effect}.
 
In the temperature limited range the current is linear with the gap voltage. The saturation currents predicted by Equations \ref{equ:egSimpleEmissionCurrentMB} and 
\ref{equ:egRDEquation} were derived assuming no gap potential. The measured saturation current is found by extrapolating the linear current-voltage line back to zero potential
voltage. This point is represented by b' in Figure \ref{fig:egCharacteristicCurve}. When the potential is zero the Richardson equation is used to find the work function of the
tungsten. Dividing Equation
\ref{equ:egRDEquation} by T$^{2}$ and then taking the log of both sides gives

\begin{equation}
ln\left(\frac{I_{S,FD}}{T^2}\right)=ln(2aA_{FD})-\frac{\phi}{kT}
\label{equ:egRichardsonPlotFD}
\end{equation}
The graph of  ln(I$_{S,FD}$/T$^2$) vs 1/T is called a \textbf{Richardson plot}. If Equation \ref{equ:egRichardsonPlotFD} holds, then the data would be expected to be a straight 
line with slope -{$\phi$}/k and intercept ln(2aA$_{FD}$).
 
The corresponding plot for classical statistics is found using Equation \ref{equ:egEmissionCurrentMB} and is 

\begin{equation}
ln\left(\frac{I_{S,MB}}{T^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)=ln(aA_{MB})-\frac{E_B}{kT}.
\label{equ:egRichardsonPlotMB}
\end{equation}

From the resulting slope in Equation \ref{equ:egRichardsonPlotFD} the work function of the tungsten can determined and compared with the accepted value {$\phi$}= 4.55eV. The 
barrier energy deduced from Equation \ref{equ:egRichardsonPlotMB} can be compared with the known value  E$_{B}$ = 13.5eV. If the experimentally determined value of the barrier
energy differs greatly from the accepted value it is possible to conclude that Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics do not apply to the electron gas in tungsten metal.

\item The temperature of the tungsten cathode is the primary factor in thermionic emission. Select a constant heating current I$_{H}$ around 2.5 A. The heating current is 
related to the temperature of the filament by the interpolation equation 

\begin{equation}
T=-6.673I_{H}^4+102I_{H}^3-574.92I_{H}^2+1764.1I_{H}-326.59.
\label{equ:egFilamentTemp}
\end{equation}
Measure the emission current I$_{E}$, when the temperature is held constant and the applied voltage V$_{m}$ is varied from 0 V to 300 V in 20 V increments. For best results
wait about half a minute to let the diode tube come to equilibrium after a change in either the temperature or the potential.
\item Repeat Step 2 with five different cathode temperatures ranging from 1800 K to 2300 K. 
\item Select a temperature between 2300 K - 2600 K.  Measure the emission current I$_{E}$, when the temperature is held constant and the applied voltage V$_{m}$ is varied 
from 0 V to 200 V in 10 V increments.  At high temperatures the emission current may be high enough that the anode power supply can not reach the full value of 200 V.
\item Repeat Step 4  with two different cathode temperatures ranging from  2300 K to 2600 K. 
\item Perform any measurements required for optional parts of the experiment.

\end{enumerate}
\section{Error Analysis}
The uncertainty in the multimeter measurements are determined as suggested on the multimeter. All the other parameters examined in this experiment are derived from
 multimeter measurements. The errors in these parameters are found using the standard techniques of error propagation.  

There are a number of systematic errors present in this experiment. The slight temperature dependence of the work function has not been included in the derivation of 
Equation \ref{equ:egRDEquation}. This can alter the constant A$_{FD}$ by factors of 2 or larger. The quantum mechanical reflections of the electrons at the surface of the 
metal are not taken into account. The reflections can modify the barrier potential. The metal surface is non uniform rather than the idealized crystal that was used. This 
changes the expected emission current. The interpolation equation for the temperature only gives the temperature at the mid-point of the filament. The leads to the filament
will cool the ends of the filament resulting in the temperature not being constant throughout the filament. Finally, because the cathode and the anode have different fermi 
energies, there exists a potential, called the \textbf{contact potential}, in the gap even when there is no applied voltage. The actual potential between the cathode and 
anode would be a sum of the applied voltage and the contact potential.  In more sophisticated models these effects can be taken into account, but they have been neglected 
in this treatment.

\section{Data Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item A table of values with errors for the emission current I$_{E}$ and applied voltage V$_{m}$ at the different temperatures T.
\item A plot of the emission current-voltage characteristics with the different regions clearly marked.
\item Linearized plots of the space charge region found in Steps 4 and 5 of the procedure.
\item A Determination of the saturation currents I$_{s}$ by extending the temperature-limited line backwards until it crosses the zero potential point (y-axis).  
\item A table of values with errors for the saturation current I$_{s}$, ln(I$_{s}$/T$^{2}$), ln(I$_{s}$/T$^{1/2}$), and 1/T.
\item The Richardson plots corresponding to Equations \ref{equ:egRichardsonPlotFD} and \ref{equ:egRichardsonPlotMB}.
\item From the Richardson plots, obtain the thermionic work function and the predicted barrier energy of tungsten. Determine which of the two statistics applies to the electron gas in the metal by comparing the work function and barrier energy to their expected values. The expected values for the work function and barrier energy of tungsten are {$\phi$} = 4.55 eV and E$_{B}$ = 13.5 eV respectively. 



\item The following portion of lab is \textbf{optional}, and is a possible topic for the poster requirement for the course.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Study the behaviour of the tube in the exponential range. To examine the exponential range a negative anode voltage is required. Change the connecting lead from the 0 - 250 V outlet to the -50 - 0 V outlet. For best results choose a cooler filament temperature around 1900 K. Obtain the current-voltage characteristic for this temperature. 
Determine the saturation current and compare it with the ones found in the temperature limited range.
\item  Equation \ref{equ:egFilamentTemp} was used to deduce the filament temperature from the heating current. There is an alternate method that can be used to calculate the filament temperature. The temperature may be calculated empirically by means of Table 1 in conjunction with the function

\begin{equation}
I_{H}^{'}=\frac{I_H}{d^{\frac{3}{2}}}\ ,
\label{equ:egFindFilamentTemp}
\end{equation}			
where the heating current is I$_{H }$ and d is filament diameter. In the electron tube used in this experiment d = 0.196 {$\pm$} 0.008 mm. This is a two step method, first find I$_{H}^{'}$from the heating current and then the temperature of the filament can be found from Table 1.

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Compare the temperatures obtained from Equation \ref{equ:egFilamentTemp} with the temperatures found from Table \ref{tbl:TempOfFilament} for the filament currents used in the experiment.

\item Graph ln(I$_{E}$) versus V$^{1/2}$ found in Step 3 of the procedure. These graphs are called \textbf{Schottky plots}. Find the saturation currents determined from the
Schottky plots by extrapolating to V = 0 and compare them with those found in Step 3 of the procedure. 

\item The practical value of a filament as an electron source is largely dependent upon the filament's electron efficiency. The electron efficiency, S, of a filament in an 
electron tube is determined by the formula

\begin{equation}
S=\frac{I_S}{P}=\frac{I_S}{VI_H},
\label{equ:egElectronEfficiency}
\end{equation}
where P is the power and V is the heating voltage. Determine the efficiency of the tube filament at three temperatures.

\section{Preparation}

You should understand the postulates that go into the derivation of the Bohr model of the atom and the outcomes of the model with regards to the quantization of energy levels. You should understand the design and outcomes of the Franck-Hertz experiment. You should be able to use a digital volt meter and digital current meter to make measurements of DC voltages and DC currents.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

At the end of this experiment, you should be able to use data including the number of scattered electrons as a function of electron energy to provide evidence of quantized atomic energy levels in helium atoms.

\section{Theory}
In this exercise, you will conduct an experiment to explore the quantization of atomic energy levels. You will collect evidence to support the results of the Bohr model, a model that suggests that an electron can only accept or emit energy in discrete amounts. To do this, you will use a tube filled with low-pressure helium gas and fitted with an electron gun and collector circuit. The electrons will serve as projectiles which collide with the helium atoms, which act as the targets.

To begin with, lets consider how energy can be transferred when two particles interact with each other. An elastic collision occurs when the total kinetic energy of both the electron and helium atom does not change. Because the helium atom is much more massive than the electron (~10$^{-26}$ kg vs. ~10$^{-30}$ kg), to a reasonable approximation, the scattered electron suffers no appreciable loss of kinetic energy. An inelastic collision occurs when the kinetic energy of both the electron and helium atom changes as a result of the interaction. Here, we might expect that a portion of the initial kinetic energy of the electron is transferred as internal energy of the helium atom. According to the Bohr model, energy is only transferred as internal energy of the helium atom in fixed amounts. It is not possible to transfer energy smoothly or continuously.


How can we observe this transfer of energy using the helium-filled tube in this experiment? If no kinetic energy is transferred from the electron to the internal energy of the atom, the collisions are elastic. Therefore, we don't expect to see a change in the kinetic energy of the scattered electrons.  However, if the kinetic energy of an electron corresponds to a quantized change in internal energy of a helium atom, then an inelastic collision could occur resulting in the electron losing all of its kinetic energy. We will look for electrons that have lost most of their kinetic energy.

\label{fig:cpTheory}
\end{figure}


In the helium tube (refer to Figure \ref{fig:cpTheory}), electrons are produced by heating a metal filament called the cathode (A). This cathode produces electrons with a relatively small variability in kinetic energy (on the order of 1 eV). The electrons are then accelerated by a potential difference between the cathode (A) and anode (B). Having gained kinetic energy, E$_{max}=eV_{max}$, the electrons then enter an essentially field-free region in the bulb where they collide with helium atoms (C). Electrons that possess a kinetic energy equivalent to the energy of an electronic transition of helium will undergo inelastic collisions with the helium atoms and lose all of their kinetic energy. The energy lost by a colliding electron goes into exciting an electron within the atom. The colliding electron is swept into the collector ring (D). This process, repeated for the many electrons emitted by the cathode, results in a current in the collector circuit. An increase in collector current is observed when increasing numbers of electrons lose kinetic energy due to inelastic collisions with the helium atom. Electrons that are not swept out of the tube by the collector ring strike the inner surface of the bulb (E), which is coated with a transparent conductive film that enables electrons to flow back to the anode.

\end{marginfigure}

By increasing the accelerating voltage from $V_{min}$ to $V_{max}$ and recording the resulting collector current we can identify those electron energies that produce spikes in collector current and thus infer the energies of electronic transitions of helium. The apparatus ramps the accelerating voltage and measures the collector current (see Figure \ref{fig:energyVsTime}) many times per second, and records the results on a computer.

%Because the collector current is so small and difficult to precisely measure and in the interest of expediting the data collection process, the experimental setup provided includes a controller which will ramp the accelerating voltage automatically and output it along with a second voltage which is proportional to the collector current.
The ramping of the accelerating voltage takes 25 seconds to complete. These voltages will be read by a Vernier voltage sensor and the data will be analysed using the LoggerPro software.

\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}

\subsection{Setting up the equipment}
\item Connect the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:cpSetup}. This circuit will power the cathode and control the accelerating voltage. Be sure to connect the Vernier voltage sensors to the LabPro in the specified channels.

\item Download the file "Evidence-for-Quantized-Atomic-Energy-Levels.cmbl" from the pjl website (www.pjl.ucalgary.ca/courses/physics325.html", and open it with the logger pro software.

\item Temporarily connect both leads from both of the voltage sensors to the ground terminal on the controller, and zero them in the software by clicking on the zeroing icon in the top toolbar. Once zeroed, reconnect the voltage sensors to the controller.

%\item Connect the negative leads of both Vernier voltage sensors to a ground terminal on the controller. Be sure to open LoggerPro \textcolor{red}{\large{{\bf (Once the cmbl file is finalized we'll have to put a reference to it in here)}}} and zero the sensors in the software before continuing.

\item Connect the positive lead of the Vernier voltage sensor connected to channel 1 to the controller terminal marked {\bf Slow 1} and the positive lead of the Vernier voltage sensor connected to channel 2 to the controller terminal marked {\bf Slow 2}.

\item Set the cathode power supply, $P1$, to $3$ V, and the anode bias power supply, $P2$, to $1.5$ V. The Fluke multimeter can be used to verify this value by connecting its leads across the terminals of the power supply.

\item Adjust the minimum and maximum voltage for each sweep by adjusting knobs 4 and 5 on the controller. Their values can be monitored via a multimeter with its negative lead connected to a ground terminal on the controller and its positive lead connected to terminals 3 or 4 (max and min, respectively) on the controller (see Figures \ref{fig:cpSetMinVoltage} and \ref{fig:cpSetMaxVoltage}). The minimum voltage, $V_{min}$, should be $~17$ V and the maximum, $V_{max}$, should be $~25$ V. Record these values, and update the corresponding in LoggerPro.

\subsection{Collecting the data}
\item In LoggerPro, click on {\bf Experiment -> Data Collection} and ensure that the {\bf length} is set to at least 26 seconds, and that the {\bf Sampling Rate} is set to 100 samples/second.

\item At this point the indicator light in the lower right corner of the critical potential tube controller should be red. If not, unplug the controller power cable and plug it back in. Click the {\bf Collect} button to begin collecting data and immediately after the sensors begin to collect measurements, press the {\bf Slow Run} button on the controller.

\item While the run is underway the {\bf Slow Run} LED indicator will be lit green. Upon completion the indicator will turn red. At this time LoggerPro will have collected a list of collector currents for each point in time during the run. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Translating the data}
We want to know the energy of incident electrons have been accelerated (accelerating voltage), and how many electrons are collected by the ring (collector current). What the Vernier voltage sensors are actually give us is a representation of those values that must be then mapped into that data we want.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item To convert back to current we just need to multiply the voltage by $-667\ \frac{A}{V}$ to obtain the proper collector current in picoAmperes. This conversion factor is determined by the electronic components used to build the current to voltage converter. This conversion has been preloaded into the column "I-collector" in the .cmbl file

\item Obtaining the accelerating voltage is more complicated. What is actually being measured is a signal that increase linearly from some initial voltage, to a final voltage over the period of 25 seconds. The good news is that we have all the information we need. We set the values of $V_{min}$ and $V_{max}$ so we know what the actual initial and final voltages are, we know that it increase linearly, and we know it takes takes 25 seconds to complete. From this we can derive the mapping function

\begin{equation}
V_{acc}(t)=\frac{V_{max}-V{min}}{25}t+V_{min}.
\label{equ:cp1}
\end{equation}

This calculation has been preloaded into the column "V-acc"



%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Linear Mapping~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





%To do this we define a function, $E=E(t)$, which maps all of our time values to energy values. Here we assume a linear relationship between time and energy as we should expect from the linearly ramping accelerating voltage.


%The circuitry in the apparatus is designed such that the accelerating voltage ramps linearly with time from the minimum voltage to the maximum voltage which means the energy of accelerated electrons does so as well. If we define two points on this line, two times and their corresponding energies, we can define the function that maps all points in time to an energy. The two best points to use are the first peak (at $E(t_1)=19.8$ eV) and the onset of ionization (at $E(t_2)=24.6$ eV).

%The equation for the line is then,

%\begin{equation}
%E(t) = 19.8+4.8\dfrac{(t-t_1)}{(t_2-t_1)}
%\label{equ:cp2}
%\end{equation}



%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~End Linear Mapping~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~






%\item In LoggerPro, click on {\it Data -> New Calculated Column...} and define a new column according to the function we determined in the previous step where the variable $t$ is replaced by the data from channel 1. Call this column $V$ for potential and give it units of $eV$. Click {\it Okay} to return to the plot.

%\item Change the x-axis of the LoggerPro plot to the previously created calculated column by clicking on the x-axis label and selecting $V$ from the list.


%\item Use the provided simulation to help answer the relevant discussion questions. \textcolor{red}{\large{{\bf (Insert name of simulation and location here, if we end up using it.)}}}

\textbf{To be handed in to the laboratory instructor}

\section{Pre-lab}
\begin{enumerate}

\item In this lab the helium spectrum is explored by increasing the energy of electrons that collide with helium atoms and measuring the resulting collector current. Sketch a prediction of what a plot of collector current versus electron energy would look like. (Hint: see Table \ref{tab:cp1} for quantum electron excitation energies)

\item Does this apparatus explore the absorption or emission spectrum of helium? Why?

\item Describe two significant differences between the apparatus that you will use in this experiment and that used by James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1914 in the so-called "Franck-Hertz Experiment" (excluding the obviously modern automated and digital components).

\item Calculate the kinetic energy of an electron accelerated through a 10.0 V potential difference, both in joules and in eV.

\item What is the order of magnitude for energy level transitions in He atoms that you expect? Discuss how you arrived at your answer.



\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
%\item A table of values for anode voltage and collector current. Include the tube operating parameters such as the cathode current and the voltage applied to the collector ring.

\item A graph of collector current versus electron energy.

%\item On the graph of collector current versus electron energy, draw the theoretical spectral lines listed in Table \ref{tab:cp1}.


\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Discuss the shape of the peaks in your graph. Why do you not observe shape changes in collector current?
%It could be argued that if the peaks are not sharp that there must not be quanized energy levels. Is this a valid conclusion, and if not suggest some alternative reasoning to explain the shape of the peaks?

%\item The current model for the helium atom suggest that the energy of the left most peak is due to  an energy level that is 19.819 eV above the ground state, and that the bottom of the linear portion of the graph that appears at higher energies corresponds to the ionization energy of 24.586 eV. Does your data refute this claim?

\item The energy of the left most peak is theoretically the result of exciting an atom from it's ground state to an excited state that is 19.819 eV above the ground state. Similarly the base of the linear portion, that appears on the right side of the graph, theoretically is the result of the incident electrons having enough energy to ionize a helium atom, where the ionization energy of 24.586 eV. What energies do you measure for these two points? If there is is a discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental results discuss potential causes for the discrepancy.

\item The visible range of wavelengths of light is between $400$ and $800$ nm. The relationship between wavelength and energy (in electronvolts) is expressed as

\begin{equation}
E(eV) = e\dfrac{hc}{\lambda}
\label{equ:cp3}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $h=6.626\times10^{-34}\ Js$ and $e=1.602\times10^{-19}\ C$. Calculate what this range is in electronvolts and discuss why one cannot observe the spectral lines of Table \ref{tab:cp1} by using a spectroscope.

\item Could one use this apparatus to observe spectral lines of helium in the visible range? Explain your answer.

%\item Using the simulation, estimate the variance (or the FWHM) of the electron energy distribution, i.e., the variance that produces a spectrum that most closely resembles the one seen in the experiment.

%\item What would the spectrum look like if we could generate electrons of a single distinct energy? Produce a sketch.

%\item What would the spectrum look like if the electrons had an equal probability of undergoing a completely inelastic collision at every energy? Produce a sketch.

%\item Describe the significant features in your graph of collector current versus anode voltage.  

%\item Discuss if your data provide evidence for quantized atomic energy levels?  Why or why not?

\item What systematic errors are present which contribute to the overall uncertainties in the experiment? 

%\item What modification could be made to the experimental setup to improve our confidence that the energy levels in atoms are quantized?

%Consider that emitted electrons must first overcome a surface barrier potential. How will this affect your determination of the kinetic energy acquired by the electrons as they are accelerated through the potential difference between the cathode and the anode? Also consider that, at a given anode voltage, there is a range in the kinetic energy of the electrons. How will this impact your results? How can you change the construction of the critical potentials tube to overcome these systematic errors?

%\section{Optional}

%\item Using the Appendix at the end of this document, identify the atomic transition(s) associated with each feature in your plot. Do any features contain multiple transitions? Is it possible to differentiate and accurately identify the energies of these overlapping spectral peaks? Why or why not?

\section{Appendix: Electronic Quantum Numbers and Atomic States}

Quantum mechanical ideas are used to describe atomic states of helium. The state of a single electron bound in an atom can be described by {\bf quantum numbers}. Note that these numbers do not apply to free electrons in the electron beam. The {\bf principal quantum number}, $n$, describes the average distance of the electron from the nucleus. Possible values for $n$ are $1,2,...$, where larger values of $n$ imply a larger average distance. The {\bf azimuthal quantum number}, $\ell$, is the orbital angular momentum of the electron. For a given $n$, the possible values of $\ell$ are integers from $0$ to $n-1$. The values of $\ell$ are often denoted by the letters; s (sharp) for $\ell=0$, p (principal) for $\ell=1$, d (diffuse) for $\ell=2$, f (fundamental) for $\ell=3$, g for $\ell=4$, h for $\ell=5$, i for $\ell=6$, k for $\ell=7$, and so forth. These names and their corresponding letters originate in early spectroscopic nomenclature. The {\bf spin}, $s$, of an electron is always $1/2$. The spin and azimuthal quantum numbers combine in two ways to give the {\bf total angular momentum quantum number}, $j$, which has values $\ell+s$ and $\ell - s$. When $\ell=0$, $j$ is $1/2$, otherwise $j$ has values $\ell+1/2$ and $\ell-1/2$.

Electrons with identical $n$, $\ell$, $j$, and $s$ still behave differently in the presence of a magnetic field. This leads to magnetic quantum numbers to further differentiate these states. The projection of l on the magnetic field direction is called, $m_{\ell}$, the {\bf magnetic orbital quantum number}. The possible values for $m_{\ell}$ are $\ell$, $\ell-1$, ...,$1$, $0$, $-1$, ..., $-\ell$. The spin can be parallel or antiparallel to the applied magnetic field. This gives the {\bf magnetic spin quantum} number $m_s$, which has the two values $1/2$ or $-1/2$. There are similar quantum restrictions for $j$ in a magnetic field. This leads to the {\bf magnetic quantum number} $m_j$ with allowable values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps. The state of a bound electron is uniquely determined by a group of four quantum numbers $(n, \ell, j, m_j)$ or $(n, \ell, m_l, m_s)$. Both systems are in common use.

Notice that both sets of four quantum numbers use $n$ and $l$. This leads to the idea of electron {\bf shells} and electron {\bf subshells}. All electrons with the same principal quantum number are said to be in the same shell. All electrons in a shell with the same azimuthal quantum number are said to be in the same subshell. For example, a $4d$ electron subshell has electrons with quantum numbers $n=4$ and $\ell=2$. So $j=3/2$ or $5/2$. For $j=3/2$, $m_j$ has possible values $-3/2$, $-1/2$, $1/2$, and $3/2$. For $j=5/2$, $m_j$ has possible values $-5/2$, $-3/2$, $-1/2$, $1/2$, $3/2$, and $5/2$. Alternatively, using the other set of four quantum numbers, $n=4$ and $\ell=2$ so $m_\ell$ has values $-2$, $-1$, $0$, $1$, and $2$ and $m_s$ has the values $1/2$ or $-1/2$. These both lead to the result that a $4d$ subshell can hold 10 electrons.

In theory, the states of the entire atom, called {\bf atomic states}, depend on the states of all the electrons in the atom, their interactions with each other, and with the nucleus. However, in practice it turns out that only electrons in {\bf unfilled subshells} affect the atomic state and the other interactions can be neglected. These outer electrons are called {\bf valence electrons}. For more than one valence electron, the atomic state of the configuration is {\bf not} simply described by the individual quantum numbers of each electron, because the electrons interact with each other as well with the nucleus. Understanding the atomic states of atoms with many electrons is still an area of research. However, for atoms with two valence electrons, it is possible to roughly describe the atomic states by a scheme called {\bf LS coupling}. In this scheme, magnetic quantum numbers are ignored. This makes it possible to determine quantum numbers for the atom as a whole from simple combinations of the individual electron quantum numbers.

The total spin, $S$, of the atomic state is determined from the sums of the individual spins of the electrons. However, $S$ is always zero or more. For an even number of electrons, $S$ is an integer. For odd numbers of electrons, $S$ is a half-integer. For a single electron $S=s=1/2$. For two electrons, $S$ can be $0$ or $1$ from the calculations $1/2-1/2$ and $1/2+1/2$. Successive values of $S$ for more electrons can be found by adding and subtracting $1/2$ to each possible value of $S$ for one less number of electrons, remembering that $S$ cannot be negative. So for three electrons, $S$ is $3/2$ or $1/2$ by the calculation $0+1/2$ and $1+1/2$. For four electrons $S$ is found by $1/2\pm1/2$ and $3/2\pm1/2$ to get $0$, $1$, and $2$. For five electrons $S$ is $1/2$, $3/2$, or $5/2$.

The total orbital angular momentum, $L$, is found from the $\ell$ of each electron. For a single valence electron $L=\ell$. Otherwise, the upper value of $L$ is the sum of all the $\ell$ values of the valence electrons. The lowest value of $L$ is the absolute value of the largest possible difference between $\ell$ values that is greater than or equal to zero. If $\ell_1=1$ and $\ell_2=2$, the possible values for $L$ are $1$, $2$, and $3$. $L$ is symbolized by the upper case letters $S$ for $L=0$, $P$ for $L=1$, and so on for $D$, $F$, $G$, $H$, $I$, $K$, $L$ in the same pattern as the lower case letters for the azimuthal quantum number $\ell$.

Once $L$ and $S$ are determined, the total atomic angular momentum, $J$, has possible values from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps. So for $L=3$ and $S=2$, $J$ has values $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$. For $L=3$ and $S=3/2$, $J$ has values $3/2$, $5/3$, $7/2$, and $9/2$. For $L \ge S$ there are $2S+1$ different values of $J$. For $L < S$ there are $2L+1$ different values for $J$. The value $2S+1$ ($2L+1$) is called the multiplicity of the levels. For the case of helium, $S$ is $0$ or $1$ so the multiplicity is $1$ or $3$. Levels with $2S+1=1$ are called singlet states. Similarly, $2S+1=2$ are doublets, $2S+1=3$ are triplets and so on.

In the $LS$ system, the atomic state is described by the $n$ and $\ell$ values of the valence electrons, the total orbital angular momentum $L$, the multiplicity $2S+1$, and the total angular momentum $J$. Notationally, the multiplicity is written as an anterior superscript, $L$ is designated by the appropriate letter and $J$ is a posterior subscript. For example $^2P_{3/2}$ is an atomic state with $L=1$, $S=1/2$, and $J=3/2$. This state is read as doublet $P$ three halves. Sodium has a single valence electron. In the ground state this valence electron has quantum numbers $n=3$, $\ell=0$. This implies that $L=0$, $S=1/2$, $2S+1 = 2$, and $J=1/2$. The ground state of Sodium is written as $3s^1\ ^2S_{1/2}$. Similarly, Potassium also has a single valence electron, but in a higher subshell. The ground state of Potassium is $4s^1\ ^2S_{1/2}$. The $\ell$ quantum number is frequently omitted when it is redundant, such as for a single valence electron. For example, the first excited state of Potassium would place the valence electron in the $4p$ subshell. This excited atomic level is designated as $4^2P_{1/2}$.

Helium levels can only be singlets or triplets because the possible values for $S$ are $0$ or $1$. Singlet helium has two electrons with opposite spin and is called Parahelium. Triplet helium has two electrons with equal spin and is called Orthohelium. In the ground state both electrons are in the $1s$ subshell. Their quantum numbers are $n=1$, $\ell=0$, $j=1/2$, and $m_j=\pm 1/2$. So the atomic state is $1^1S_0$.

Table \ref{tab:cp1} and Figure \ref{fig:cpGrotrian} show some of the excited states of helium. One electron moves to successively higher energies while the other one remains at the lowest possible energy. Note that singlet states really are single and that triplet states really do appear with three distinct energies, except for $L<S$. States where both electrons are above the ground state are possible but quite uncommon.

\section{Preparation}

Review the de Broglie hypothesis.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

To show that electrons interact with a crystal in a manner consistent with waves rather than classical particles. To show that the pattern produced
by the outgoing electrons is the diffraction pattern expected from waves whose wavelength is related to the electron energy by the de Broglie 
relation and Planck's law.

\section{Theory}



Light is known to behave in dualistic ways; it behaves like a stream of particles in some experiments and like a wave in others. In 1924, Louis de 
Broglie (1892-1987) suggested that the same might be true of electrons. His electron wave hypothesis was, at the time, a radical departure from established 
concepts, but received, almost immediately, experimental verification. It was observed that a beam of electrons, striking a foil target, produced a
pattern that was just like an interference pattern for light. Hence, electrons did exhibit wave characteristics similar to those of photons. The 
relationship between electron wavelength ${\lambda}$, electron momentum p and Planck's constant h (h=4.136x10$^{-15}$eV$\cdot{s}$ or 6.626x10$^{-34}$J$\cdot{s}$) is 

\begin{equation}
\lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.
\label{equ:WavelengthAndMomentum}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for electron energy E and electron frequency f

\begin{equation}
E=hf.
\label{equ:EnergyAndFrequency}
\end{equation}

In this experiment, electrons, emerging from the cathode due to thermionic emission, are subjected to an accelerating potential V$_{a}$ and 
incident on a carbon film target. The carbon film target consists of randomly oriented sheets of carbon atoms. In each sheet, the atoms are in a 
hexagonal arrangement which provides two distinct diffraction planes, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:CrystalStructure}, with spacing d$_{a}$
= 0.123 nm  and d$_{b}$ = 0.213 nm. It is noted that the random orientation of carbon atom sheets will correspond to the rotating optical 
grating in the demonstration, hence, if waves were diffracted by this carbon film target, a circular pattern would be anticipated. As there are 
effectively two gratings involved, two separate series of maxima are anticipated in the resulting diffraction pattern.

An electron accelerated by a voltage V$_{a}$ has the energy

\begin{equation}
E=eV_{a}=\frac{p^2}{2m}
\label{equ:ElectronEngergy}
\end{equation}
where e is the charge of the electron (e=1.602x10$^{-19}$C), and m is the mass of the electron (m=0.511MeV/c$^{2}$ or 9.109x10$^{-31}$ kg). In this case Equation 
\ref{equ:EnergyAndFrequency} can be written as 

\begin{equation}
\lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV_{a}}}
\label{equ:WavelengthOfElectron}
\end{equation}
where  e  is the electron charge, $V_a$ is the accelerating voltage and  m  is the electron mass. Furthermore, from Equations 
\ref{equ:DiffractionCondition2} and \ref{equ:WavelengthOfElectron}, 	

\begin{equation}
H=\frac{Ah}{d\sqrt{2meV_{a}}},
\label{equ:RingRadius}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{equ:WavelengthOfElectron} can be used to determine {$\lambda$} for an electron with energy eV$_{a}$. Equation \ref{equ:RingRadius} can be used to calculate the lattice spacing constants d$_{a}$ and d$_{b}$ for a carbon lattice.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Somewhere in the room there will be set up a two dimensional grating. When illuminated with a He-Ne laser, this grating will produce a 
rectangular array of dots on the screen/wall. As you spin the grating, which is free to rotate, the rectangular array will merge into concentric 
circles.
\item Using the supplied calipers, measure the target-screen distance B and the radius of the bulb R. Connect the circuit shown in \ref{fig:ExperimentalSetup}. Have your
lab instructor inspect it before applying power. Set the variable resistance to 20 ${\Omega}$  and turn on the 6.3 VAC heater power supply. The heater
current should be about 200 mA. At this current, the heater element should glow red hot. If the heater glows too hot (orange-yellow) increase the 
resistance in the circuit to about 25-30 ${\Omega}$.
\item Turn on the high voltage power supply (\ul{be extremely careful with any high voltage power supplies}) and increase the accelerating voltage 
V$_{a}$ to about 5,400 V. At this voltage, the intensity of the screen pattern will be at its maximum. It may be necessary to adjust the heater
current again in order to obtain easy legibility of the scale divisions on the optical scale projector. The heater has a thermal response time of 
about 30 s. The focusing voltage should be kept constant at -25.0 V  throughout the experiment. Use the adjustable magnet to focus the electron beam at the centre of the tube face before taking any measurements.
\item Measure H using the supplied optical projectors. The illuminated scale produces a virtual image extending out into space beyond the plexiglass end of the instrument. The virtual image can be positioned in the plane of the diffraction rings for very accurate readings. Align the scale projector perpendicular to the axis to measure H.

H  for 10 different values of  V$_{a}$ ranging from 5,400 to 3,000 V  in 250 V decrements.
\item Due to the small size of the diffraction tube, only two rings will be visible. Both rings have n=1, see Equation \ref{equ:DiffractionCondition}, 
and correspond to the two grating constants resulting from the hexagonal structure of the carbon film. Determine which ring corresponds to which 
grating constant (d$_{a}$ or d$_{b}$). The diffraction rings are observed on the inner spherical surface of the diffraction tube. The carbon target is
not positioned at the centre of tube curvature and, as a consequence, A must be calculated for each H 
%and X data pair 
separately.   
\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}

Uncertainties in H 
%and X 
originate from simple measurements and can be estimated individually. Uncertainties for voltage measurements, however, result
from instrument errors for both the high voltage probe and the Fluke multimeter, and must be considered jointly. See the back panel on the multimeter.
The accuracy of the high voltage probe is 1\%. Propagate uncertainties using an appropriate method.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

The purpose of the laboratory is to introduce the student to the phenomenon of radioactive decay and introduce the idea of half-life. Students will also
acquire experience in radiation measurement techniques.

\section{Theory}

The decay of radioactive material is a process which follows statistical laws. It is impossible to predict when one particular nucleus in the material 
will suddenly decay. Predictions can only be made when large numbers of nuclei are considered, and here, only the average number of nuclei which will 
decay can be predicted. The larger the number of nuclei the more accurate will be the theoretical predictions.

It is always found that the average rate at which nuclei decay is proportional to the total number still left unchanged. This can be written as

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dt}=-{\lambda}N,
\label{equ:rdAverageDecayRate}
\end{equation}

where N is the number of nondecayed nuclei still present and the proportionality constant {$\lambda$} is called the decay constant. The constant 
{$\lambda$} is a characteristic property of the kind of radioactive nuclei under consideration. The negative sign is used because N decreases with 
increasing time due to disintegration of the nuclei. If N$_{0}$ is the number of atoms at t=$0$, integration of Equation \ref{equ:rdAverageDecayRate} 
gives

\begin{equation}
N(t)=N_{0}e^{-{\lambda}t},
\label{equ:rdExpDecay}
\end{equation}
where N(t) is the number of atoms left at time t which have not undergone nuclear decay. 

At a time t=T$_{half}$, when half of the original atoms have decayed, we have

\begin{equation}
N(T_{half})=\frac{N_{0}}{2},
\label{equ:rdNAtHalfLife}
\end{equation}
and Equation \ref{equ:rdExpDecay} takes the form

\begin{equation}
T_{half}=\frac{ln2}{\lambda}\cong\frac{0.693}{\lambda}.
\label{equ:rdHalfLife}
\end{equation}

Since this is the time for one half of the atoms to undergo decay, the quantity T$_{half}$ is called the \textbf{half-life}.
\\

A Geiger counter pointed at the radioactive source gives a count rate R which is proportional to the rate of decay dN/dt. This means R=kN and 
R$_{0}$=kN$_{0}$ when t=$0$. The proportionality constant k is less than one. When both sides of Equation \ref{equ:rdExpDecay} are multiplied by k the result
becomes

\begin{equation}
R=R_{0}e^{-{\lambda}t}.
\label{equ:rdCountRate}
\end{equation}
Once ${\lambda}$ is known, the half-life can be found from Equation \ref{equ:rdHalfLife}.

\section{Apparatus}

The source of radioactive $^{116}$In used in this experiment is prepared as follows. Before the start of the lab, samples of indium metal ($^{115}$In) 
will have been made artificially radioactive by irradiating them with neutrons for several hours. This process is called "neutron activation". A metal 
foil of pure indium, 96\% of which is the isotope indium-115, is subjected to neutron bombardment from a strong neutron source. The probability of 
neutron capture by the indium is enhanced by several orders of magnitude if the activating neutrons are slowed down. This is accomplished by surrounding
the neutron source with paraffin wax so that the neutrons suffer repeated collisions with hydrogen nuclei losing some kinetic energy each time. The 
nuclear reaction for the neutron activation of indium-115 is

\begin{equation}
_{49}^{115}In+\ _{0}^{1}n\rightarrow\ _{49}^{116}In\ (unstable).
\label{equ:rdIn115ToIn116}
\end{equation}
The unstable $^{116}$In then decays by the nuclear reaction

\begin{equation}
_{49}^{116}In\rightarrow\ _{50}^{116}Sn\ +\ \beta^{-} +\ \bar{\nu}_e.
\label{equ:rdIn116ToSn116}
\end{equation}
Notice that what has happened is that a neutron in the nucleus has decayed into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino by the reaction

\begin{equation}
_{0}^{1}n\rightarrow\ _{1}^{1}p\ +\ e^{-} +\ \bar{\nu}_e.
\label{equ:rdNeutronDecay}
\end{equation}
some of the indium metal has been transmuted into tin metal by this process.
\\

Detection of the indium radiation is accomplished by means of a Geiger-Mueller counter. The Geiger tube registers a count as soon as a charged particle
enters the sensitive volume inside. It misses a count only when two charged particles enter in such close succession that the tube has not yet recovered 
from the first particle when the second one arrives. The tube is thus basically 100\% efficient in registering alpha and beta particles at low count 
rates, provided they can penetrate into the Geiger tube. For this reason the entrance window to the tube is a very thin piece of mica (it has a mass of 
only 2-3 mg/cm$^{2}$). Please do not touch the mica window as it is very easily broken. Once the power is turned on the counter will accumulate events for the
time interval preset on the front dial. A light will flash once for every 10 events detected. Once time is up the display changes to the new reading of
counts detected in that interval. To begin a new detection sequence the reset button is pressed.  Note that after the counter begins accumulating events
pressing the reset button will not start the counter over. The reset button is only active after the preset time interval has passed.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Even when there is no activated indium present the Geiger counter will still detect events. This happens because of the presence of cosmic rays and
natural radioactivity in the building, the air, and even the Geiger tube walls. This \textbf{background} radiation must be subtracted from readings taken
with the indium present, so that the radiation intensity due solely to the indium is measured.
\item Power up the Geiger counter and let it stabilize for five minutes. Then with the detector placed exactly the same way as when measuring the indium
obtain 5 samples of background radiation. Each sample should be taken with the counter set for a 3 minute acquisition. The average of these 5 readings 
will be the background that you subtract from each indium reading. 
\item When you are ready to measure the radioactive indium take the sample tray from under the Geiger tube and bring it to the laboratory technician who 
will be present at the back of the room. This person will give you a sample of the activated indium to measure. Place the sample tray under the detector
tube in the same place it was for the background measurements.
\item Leave the count time for the Geiger counter set at 3 minutes. Start the stopwatch and reset the Geiger counter at the same time. For the next 80 -
120 minutes at 4 minute intervals  reset the Geiger counter to take a new reading. Make sure to record the counts obtained in each 4 minute interval 
before resetting the Geiger counter. The Geiger counter acquires data for 3 minutes  so there will be a spare minute to take down the reading and get 
ready to start the next cycle.

Note 1) \textbf{Do not} move the indium or the Geiger counter while measuring the decay. If the distance from the Geiger counter to the sample were to 
change the readings will alter. What you have done is change the value of k in the middle of the experiment.

Note 2) \textbf{Do not} touch the indium with your fingers or lose it on the floor. This isotope has been chosen because it is a weak, short half-life 
beta emitter with low chemical activity so it is not dangerous. But it always pays to be careful.

Note 3) If the counting rate with the fresh indium source is less than 5 times the background counting rate, consult your instructor.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}

The total number of detected counts, R$_{T}$, must be converted to counts per minute for analysis. This is done to eliminate differences due to different Geiger counter sampling times. The Geiger counter counts per minute, R$_{g}$, is given by

\begin{equation}
R_{g}=\frac{R_{T}}{count\ time}.
\label{equ:rdMeasuredCountsPerMinute}
\end{equation}

The actual indium counts per minute, R$_{a}$, are then found from the expression

\begin{equation}
R_{a}=R_{g}-R_{b},
\label{equ:rdCorrectedCountsPerMinute}
\end{equation}
where R$_{g}$ is the total counts per minute measured by the Geiger counter (sample plus background) and $R_{b}$ is the number of \textbf{background counts per minute}. Again, the background counts per minute are determined from the total number of background counts, R$_{Tb}$, by use of Equation \ref{equ:rdMeasuredCountsPerMinute}.


It is important to realize that it is in principle impossible to determine $R_{b}$ precisely. It is only possible to determine the average background counts per minute, $\hat{R}_b$  separately from R$_{g}$. This average background count rate approximates the true background that really occurred while the sample was being measured. The best estimate of R$_a$ then must be

\begin{equation}
R_{a}=R_{g}-\hat{R_{b}}.
\label{equ:rdFinalCountsPerMinute}
\end{equation}

We can express this in terms of the raw counts collected from the Geiger counter, $R_T$ and $R_{Tb}$.

\begin{equation}
R_a=\dfrac{R_T}{3}-\dfrac{1}{5}\sum\limits_{i=1}^5R_{b_i}=\dfrac{R_T}{3}-\dfrac{1}{15}\sum\limits_{i=1}^5R_{Tb_i}
\label{equ:rdActualCounts}
\end{equation}

By assuming independent (uncorrelated) variables, we can approximate the uncertainty in the measurement of $R_a$ by the method of partial derivatives, i.e., 

\begin{equation}
u(R_a)\approx \sqrt{\left| \dfrac{\partial R_a}{\partial R_T}\right|^2u(R_T)^2+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{5}\left| \dfrac{\partial R_a}{\partial R_{Tb_i}}\right|^2u(R_{Tb_i})^2}
\label{equ:rdActualCountsError}
\end{equation}

The assumption of non-correlation between $R_T$ and $R_{Tb}$ is a reasonable one since the background counts depend only on constants of the lab environment and not on the measurements of $R_T$. We find the following expression for the uncertainty in $R_a$,

\begin{equation}
u(R_a)=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{9}R_T+\dfrac{1}{225}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{5}R_{Tb_i}}
\label{equ:rdErrorInRa}
\end{equation}

or in terms of the averaged background counts per minute, $\hat{R}_{Tb}$,

\begin{equation}
u(R_a)=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{9}R_T+\dfrac{1}{15}\hat{R}_{Tb}}
\label{equ:rdActualCountsError2}
\end{equation}

\section{Discussion}

Compare the experimental value for the half-life with published values. You may wish to consult the CRC Handbook for such data. Quantitatively show how well the experimental and tabulated data agree. If the values are not in good agreement, discuss possible sources of systematic and random error in the experiment. Discuss why it was assumed that the value of the proportionality constant k is less than one (as was done to obtain Equation \ref{equ:rdCountRate} from Equation \ref{equ:rdExpDecay}).

\section{{\bf Preperation}}

The student should review this lab write-up and the chapter in the textbook on the historical development of Quantum Mechanics, specifically those parts relating to 
Blackbody Radiation. In addition, the student should ensure that they understand how a thermocouple and thus a thermopile operates.

\section{{\bf Goals of the Experiment}}
To measure the radiation incident on a detector observing a blackbody source as a function of the distance from the source and the temperature of the source.  To determine 
the total radiant energy from the source and to examine the relationship between the temperature of a black body and the energy of the radiation emitted.

\section{{\bf Theory}}

Frequently, when an object is heated, it changes color and the color of the object is a good indicator of how hot it is. The red hot element on an electric range is
cooler than the white hot element in a light bulb but it is hotter than an automobile radiator that does not appear to be glowing at all. By the 1800's physicists 
were able to measure the radiation given off by a body and they found that it varies in a very predictable manner that depends on the temperature of the body. It was
found that the {\bf intensity}  of radiation emitted from an ideal nonreflecting surface varies as the {\bf fourth power} of its temperature. This relationship is now known as 
the {\bf Stefan-Boltzmann law}. The idealized nonreflecting surface that radiates only according to its temperature is now known as a black body. A {\bf black body} is an object
that emits electromagnetic radiation which depends {\bf only} on the temperature of the body.

The form of the law involving the fourth power greatly interested physicists. Considerable work was done to understand why the Stefan-Boltzmann law had this 
particular form. No one was able to correctly derive the behaviour of a black body until in 1900 Max Planck realized that an extra fundamental assumption was 
required. This was the idea that radiation is {\bf quantized} and can only be emitted in discrete energy packets. This insight was the beginning of quantum theory. So in a
sense, this experiment, which examines the radiation emitted by a black body, is the originator of quantum theory.

It turns out that a hot furnace with a {\bf hole} in it is a fairly good approximation of a black body. The hole in the furnace acts like a {\bf radiator} of electromagnetic 
energy. The {\bf size} of the furnace determines the amount of power coming out of the hole. The {\bf area} of hole determines the size of the black body. The {\bf temperature} of 
the furnace determines the spectrum of the emitted radiation. Note that all three of these properties of the furnace can be varied independently. A blast furnace at
a steel mill emits considerably more power than a pottery kiln even though they both could be operating at the same temperature. In either furnace, a hole in the 
side could have different sizes no matter what the temperature is.

Suppose the black body has area A and emits a total power P$_{t}$. Then the {\bf radiance} of the black body, R, is defined as the total power radiated per unit area, so that

\end{marginfigure}


\begin{equation}
R=\frac{P_t}{A}.
\label{equ:bbRadianceFromPower}
\end{equation}

The radiance of a black body follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
R=\sigma T^4,
\label{equ:bbRadianceFromTemp}
\end{equation}
where T is the temperature of the body in Kelvins and $\sigma$ is the {\bf Stefan-Boltzmann constant}.

Suppose that the radiant energy from the hole in the furnace is uniformly distributed over the entire forward hemisphere. Also, assume that the source area is small
enough that the radiant energy being emitted from it can be approximated as a point source. Then to measure the black body radiation, a {\bf detector} has to be placed 
somewhere inside this forward hemisphere. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:bbDetector}, clearly, a detector of area, a, at some distance, r, from the oven will intercept only a small 
fraction of the emitted power. The amount depends on the size of the detector aperture as well as its distance from the oven. Let the amount of power incident on 
the detector be P$_{i}$. Then if the fact that the detector is flat instead of hemispherical is also ignored, the amount of incident power is

\begin{equation}
P_i = \frac{a}{2 \pi r^2}P_t.
\label{equ:bbCorrectedIncidentPower}
\end{equation}
Taking Equations \ref{equ:bbRadianceFromPower} through \ref{equ:bbCorrectedIncidentPower} together yields the formula

\begin{equation}
R=\frac{2 \pi r^2}{aA}P_i.
\label{equ:bbRadius}
\end{equation}
%added Nov 24, 2016 to provide a complete model for testing.
Finally by equating Equations \ref{equ:bbRadianceFromTemp} and \ref{equ:bbRadius} a model

\begin{equation}
P_{i}=\frac{a A \sigma}{2 \pi r^{2}}T^{4}
\label{equ:bbModel}
\end{equation}
is obtained that, if valid, predicts the relationship between the Power output by a black body, and it's temperature.

The detector outputs a voltage that is proportional to the incident detected power. A multimeter is used to measure this voltage. The digital multimeter is a 
sensitive instrument, and susceptible to thermal voltages in its circuitry. Therefore, it is best to leave it on for about half an hour before making observations. 
This allows the instrument to reach a uniform operating temperature throughout.

The detector is called a {\bf Moll's thermopile}. It is a collection of constantan-manganin thermocouples. Each thermocouple is a metal junction in which a heat gradient 
induces a potential difference. The conversion factor that relates detector voltage to incident power is given on the apparatus. This factor takes the form of a 
number like 22 $\frac{mV}{mW}$. The entrance to the detector is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bbThermopile}. It is a polished metal funnel which has a 22{$^\circ$} angle of aperture. A hole at the pointed end 
is the actual entrance to the detector and it has a diameter of 0.01 m.

  \caption{Dimensions of the Moll's Thermopile}
  \label{fig:bbThermopile}
\end{figure}

The thermopile is very sensitive to infrared radiation. Unfortunately, every physical body radiates thermal energy that can be detected by the thermopile, which 
affects the results of the experiment. Once data taking commences, experimenters should avoid being anywhere where radiation from a body or clothing may be detected
by the thermopile. The apparatus should be located as far as possible from any reflecting surfaces, both in front and to the side. For protection, there is a glass 
cover on the detector. This must be removed before taking measurements.

The radiation to be examined is that which emanates from the cylindrical cavity of the oven insert, which is assumed to emit like a black body. However, surfaces of
the oven also radiate energy as the oven heats up, which would contaminate the black body results. To avoid this contamination, a cooling jacket is placed in front 
of the oven, with its aperture centered on the oven opening. Cold tap water circulating through the cold jacket keeps its' temperature at about 10 $^{\circ}$C, which should 
reduce surface radiation to insignificant levels.

The iris between the oven and the detector serves to limit the field of view of the detector, ideally just to the aperture inside the cold jacket. In reality this is
difficult to achieve, but a good approximation would be to set the iris opening to be slightly smaller than that of the detector funnel. To minimize losses in the 
detector cone due to multiple reflections (each reflection causes a slight reduction in intensity), the detector should be far enough from the source that each ray 
is reflected at most once. There is a minimum distance beyond which the detector should be placed so that multiple reflections cannot occur. This minimum distance 
can be determined from the geometry of the funnel seen in Figure \ref{fig:bbThermopile} and the diameters of the source and detector apertures.

\section{{\bf Experimental Procedure}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check to see if the multimeter and the oven have been warmed up prior to the lab period.  The oven should be warmed up to at least 600 {$^\circ$}C. If this has not been
done, turn on the multimeter and the Variac, increase the Variac power to 85\%, and go have a coffee! Also, make sure that cold water is circulating through the cold
jacket. It will take about 50-60 minutes for the equipment to be ready, if it is starting cold.
\item Find the calibration label on the thermopile that you will be using during this experiment and record the calibration factor in your lab notebook.
\item Using the vernier calipers, measure the openings in the cold jacket and the funnel entrance.  Set the detector at 40 cm from the source, with the iris midway 
between them, and adjust the iris opening to an appropriate size. Make sure all components are properly aligned. {\bf Do NOT} poke anything into the inner aperture of the
funnel. The thermopile detector is fragile and expensive and cannot be disturbed.
\item To test the dependence of radiative intensity on distance from the source, keep the oven temperature constant and take readings of power (voltage) for varying
detector positions, from 40 cm to 150 cm.  Keep the iris at a constant distance from the detector, about 20 cm away.  At least ten different distances should be 
measured.
\item Determine a suitable separation between the source and the detector to keep reflections in the funnel at one or less. To test the relationship of radiance and
temperature, turn the oven off and take measurements every 30 {$^\circ$}C from 600 {$^\circ$}C down to 300 {$^\circ$}C. Again, keep the iris about 20 cm from the 
detector.
\end{enumerate}

\section{{\bf Error Analysis}}

Most of the measurement errors will be standard reading errors, tempered with the judgment of the experimenter. The thermopile - voltmeter combination introduces some
significant uncertainties into the calculations. Due to fluctuations in voltmeter readings, an error of 0.01 mV is suggested for the voltmeter. The student is free to
investigate this and come up with alternatives, within reason. If the PASCO thermopile is used, the absorbing surface occupies only 1/6 of the area at the back of 
the funnel.  This suggests that about 1/6 of the radiation incident on the funnel opening will be recorded by the voltmeter, but warming of adjacent surfaces may 
increase this amount. Relative to these uncertainties, measurement errors in aperture sizes and oven temperatures should be insignificant.

Review the principles of the blackbody spectrum.

\section{{\bf Goals of the Experiment}}

To understand the idea of colour temperature, and how to measure it with an optical pyrometer. To get more experience with the black body spectrum. To learn the basic ideas of quantitative colour theory.

\section{{\bf Theory}}


It is known from experience that glowing coals are warmer than wood and that a rock is not as hot as molten lava. When a cold stove element is turned on to high it becomes warmer, soon begins to glow a deep red and glows a brighter and a lighter red as it continues to heat up. It turns out that there is a direct relation between the colour that an object glows and how hot it is. Blacksmiths have often applied this concept in their metal work. The metal would be left in the forge until it glowed the proper colour and then shaped. It is possible to tell that the metal just pulled from the forge is hot without even touching it. The heat {\bf radiating} from it can be felt without direct contact.
   
Every body warmer than its surroundings radiates heat in the form of {\bf electromagnetic radiation}. The total intensity of the radiation increases with the temperature of the body. The emission is spread over the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Each wavelength is emitted with a different intensity. A plot of the intensity radiated at each wavelength for the entire electromagnetic spectrum is known as an intensity spectrum. It turns out that the {\bf intensity spectrum} of a body changes with the temperature of the body.

  \label{fig:ctBlackbodyCavity}
\end{marginfigure}


An intensity spectrum of interest in the latter half of the 19th century was that of the {\bf black body}. A black body is any object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation. Black bodies must also be in thermodynamic equilibrium with their surroundings. To accommodate this condition, black bodies are typically made in the form of a cavity which would ideally have no openings. Such a design would ensure that no radiation from the body could escape thus ensuring the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium. In practice however an enclosed cavity does not provide any way to examine the radiation inside the body. For experimental purposes a small hole is made in the cavity. Such a cavity is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ctBlackbodyCavity}. As long as this hole is small compared to the dimensions of the cavity the amount of radiation being lost will also be quite small compared to the radiation being emitted and absorbed by the cavity walls.

Physicists working with black bodies were trying to obtain a mathematical expression that described its intensity spectrum at all temperatures. In 1900 Lord Rayleigh (1842-1919) proposed a formula that worked well at long wavelengths, but broke down at shorter ones. This formula is now known as the Rayleigh-Jeans formula in honour of James Jeans (1877-1946) who discovered a correction to the formula. Shortly afterwards Max Planck (1858-1947) announced that he had derived an expression that agreed across the entire spectrum with experimental data taken at a wide range of temperatures. His expression was based on the assumption that the radiation was quantized. Planck's assumption was an early supporter  of quantum theory. A black body intensity spectrum at a given temperature is given by {\bf Planck's distribution equation} which states that


\begin{equation}
I_{B}(\lambda,T_{B}) = \frac{2\pi hc^{2} \lambda^{-5} }{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda kT_{B}}}-1},
\label{equ:ctPlanckDistributionEquation}
\end{equation}
where  h is Planck's constant (h=6.6261x10$^{-34}$ Js), c is the speed of light (c=2.9979x10$^{8}$ $\frac{m}{s}$), k is Boltzmann's constant (k=1.3807x10$^{-23}$ $\frac{J}{K}$), $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, and T$_{B}$ is the temperature of the blackbody. I$_{B}$ is the intensity of radiation for a given wavelength and temperature of a blackbody.

  \label{fig:ctPlancksDistribution}
\end{figure}



Figure \ref{fig:ctPlancksDistribution} shows a plot of Equation \ref{equ:ctPlanckDistributionEquation} for three different temperatures. There are two important characteristics to note from this plot. First, the peaks of the plots shift towards shorter wavelengths with an increase in temperature, and second, the area under the curve also increases with temperature indicating that total intensity of the radiation increases with temperature. The two vertical lines in Figure \ref{fig:ctBlackbodyCavity} indicate the upper and lower limits of the {\bf visible spectrum}. It can be seen that part of the radiation of a hot black body lies in the visible range. This explains why some hot bodies glow.

The intensity spectrum which is emitted by a given body is dependent on the temperature of that body. Cooler bodies (below $\sim$700 K) radiate mostly in the infrared range of the spectrum and therefore are not visible to the human eye. However, when bodies are heated above this, the intensity radiated at wavelengths in the visible region is large enough that the body begins to glow a deep red. As the body is heated further it becomes brighter, and the colour changes to yellow, to white, and eventually to blue (at $\sim$20000 K). The radiated spectrum and the visible colour are both fingerprints of the temperature.

{\bf Colour temperature} is the colour that a body glows at a given temperature. The {\bf colour temperature method} determines the unknown temperature of a glowing body by matching its intensity spectrum, or rather its colour, with the spectrum of a glowing black body of known temperature. The temperature obtained is known as its {\bf black body temperature}. Figure \ref{fig:ctPlancksDistribution} implies that when the temperature of a body increases the intensity radiated at each wavelength also increases. What this indicates is that the intensity radiated at any given wavelength is also a fingerprint of the temperature of the body. So, if the intensity at one wavelength of a blackbody's intensity spectrum is the same as the intensity of the same wavelength of a second blackbody's intensity spectrum then it can be assumed that both intensity spectra are also the same. If the intensity spectra of both bodies are the same then they are also at the same temperature.

  \caption{An Optical Pyrometer}
  \label{fig:ctPyrometer}
\end{figure}


The instrument used to compare the intensities at a given wavelength of two glowing bodies is known as a {\bf pyrometer} and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ctPyrometer}. Inside the pyrometer is a {\bf reference wire} with an adjustable current. By adjusting the current through the wire, the temperature can be altered. The pyrometer is calibrated so that the black body temperature of the reference wire is known. A microscope located at one end of the pyrometer is used to focus the pyrometer on a sample body of unknown temperature and the light from the glowing sample is superimposed  over the reference wire. The light from the superimposed bodies is then sent through a filter which allows only a small bandwidth of light, centred around a wavelength of 653 nm, to pass thorough. The current through the reference wire, and therefore its temperature, is adjusted until the intensities radiated at this wavelength by both bodies are the same. When this state is reached, the reference wire "disappears" into the sample body. They now appear to be the same colour and it can be assumed that the two bodies have the same intensity spectrum, and therefore the same temperature.

A common example of a glowing body is the light bulb. In this experiment the colour temperature of a tungsten filament from a quartz halogen lamp will be examined. Light bulb filaments are made of tungsten because of its extremely high melting point. The problem with tungsten is that at high temperatures it will oxidize in the presence of air forming toxic tungsten oxide. To avoid this problem the tungsten is encased in quartz envelope which has had the air replaced with a small amount of a halogen, usually iodine or bromine. Tungsten evaporates at high temperatures, which causes the filament to weaken and eventually break. Vapour from the tungsten also eventually comes into contact with the cooler quartz and condenses, forming a coating which obstructs the light from the filament. To solve these problems the quartz envelope is filled with a halogen gas. The vapour reacts with the gas at a much lower temperature than the melting point of tungsten. Tungsten vapour would much rather form with the gas than condense on the quartz, therefore reducing the tungsten coating on the quartz. When the gas which has formed with tungsten approaches the filament it becomes hotter, and the tungsten returns to the filament. This reaction is most likely to occur at the hotter parts of the filament which are also the thinnest. The filament is therefore self-repairing which increases the life of the bulb. 

The quartz however causes a small percentage of the electromagnetic radiation to be reflected back. A small correction must be made to account for this loss in intensity. This correction is obtained using Fresnel's equation for incident light that is perpendicular to the normal of the surface. Fresnel's equations for the first interface states that 

\begin{equation}
\frac{I_{r}}{I_{i}} = \left(\frac{n-n^{\prime}}{n+n^{\prime}}\right)^{2},
\label{equ:ctIntensityRatio}
\end{equation}
where I$_{r}$ is the intensity of the light that is reflected at the first interface, I$_{i}$ is the intensity of the incident light on this interface, n is the index of reflection for quartz (n=1.54), and n$^{\prime}$ is the index of refraction for a vacuum (n$^{\prime}$=1). Note that the index of refraction of a gas is often approximated as the index of refraction of a vacuum. From the conservation of energy, the total intensity of light into the first interface must equal the total intensity out. As a result

  \caption{Determining the fraction of light intensity that is passed through a quarts bulb}
  \label{fig:ctQuartzBulb}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{equation}
I_{i} = I_{r} + I_{t}
\label{equ:ctIncidentIntensity}
\end{equation}
where I$_{t}$ is the intensity of light transmitted through the interface. 

The intensity of the light transmitted through the first interface is therefore

\begin{equation}
I_{t} = I_{i}\left[1-\left(\frac{n-n^{\prime}}{n+n^{\prime}}\right)^{2}\right]=I_{i}^{\prime}.
\label{equ:ctTransmittedIntensity}
\end{equation}
The intensity of light transmitted through the first interface is the intensity of light that is incident on the second interface. Using the same reasoning as above, the intensity transmitted through the second surface I$_{t}^{\prime}$, is   

\begin{equation}
I_{t}^{\prime} = I_{i}^{\prime}\left[1-\left(\frac{n-n^{\prime}}{n+n^{\prime}}\right)^{2}\right]=I_{i}\left[1-\left(\frac{n-n^{\prime}}{n+n^{\prime}}\right)^{2}\right]^{2}.
\label{equ:ctTransmittedIntensity2}
\end{equation}
For simplicity let 

\begin{equation}
\delta = \left[1-\left(\frac{n-n^{\prime}}{n+n^{\prime}}\right)^{2}\right]^{2},
\label{equ:ctFresnelCorrection}
\end{equation}
be the {\bf Fresnel correction}. Then the actual initial intensity of the light radiated by the wire, I$_{i}$, is,

\begin{equation}
I_{i}=\frac{I_{t}^{\prime}}{\delta}.
\label{equ:ctFresnelCorrection2}
\end{equation}							
With the Fresnel correction included, Equation \ref{equ:ctPlanckDistributionEquation} is written as 

\begin{equation}
I_{B}(\lambda,T_{B}) = \frac{2\pi hc^{2} \lambda^{-5}\delta^{-1}}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda kT_{B}}}-1}.
\label{equ:ctPlanckDistributionEquation2}
\end{equation}

	Equation \ref{equ:ctPlanckDistributionEquation2} applies to black bodies. However many glowing objects, including tungsten filaments, are not black bodies but are rather {\bf gray bodies}. A gray body is any body that reflects some electromagnetic radiation. Gray bodies have a emission spectrum that is dependent not only on temperature, but also on how close the body is to being a black body. It turns out that each body has an intrinsic temperature dependent proportionality function, known as its {\bf emissivity}. Emissivity is unitless and has values that lie between 0 and 1. A perfect black body has an emissivity of 1. There are two different types of emissivity that are used in this experiment. There is one that is used when dealing with the entire intensity spectrum of a body, known as the {\bf total emissivity}, $\varepsilon_{T}$, and a second that is used when dealing with only one wavelength, known as the {\bf spectral emissivity}, $\varepsilon_{S}$. It is important to note that spectral emissivity is valid only for a specified wavelength and that each wavelength has a different spectral emissivity. In this experiment the spectral emissivity at 650 nm is used because this is the wavelength of light for which the pyrometer is sensitized. In the case of tungsten the spectral emissivity is given by

\begin{equation}
\resizebox{.9\hsize}{!}{$\varepsilon_{S} (T_{B} , \lambda = 650 nm) = -3.8798x10^{-10}T_{B}^{2} - 2.3877x10^{-5}T_{B}+4.8189x10^{-1}$},
\label{equ:ctSpectralEmissivity}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_{S}$ is the spectral emissivity as a function of the black body temperature and wavelength.

	The black body intensity spectrum of a gray body is obtained by multiplying the intensity spectrum of a gray body by the emissivity. The intensity spectrum of a gray body is described by the equation

\begin{equation}
I_{G}(\lambda,T_{G}) = \frac{2\pi hc^{2} \lambda^{-5} \varepsilon_{S}}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda kT_{G}}}-1},
\label{equ:ctGreyBody}
\end{equation}
where I$_{G}$ is the intensity spectrum of a gray body with a temperature T$_{G}$.

Since the pyrometer measures intensities, the gray body's temperature can be obtained by equating Equations \ref{equ:ctPlanckDistributionEquation2} and \ref{equ:ctGreyBody} to get
				
\begin{equation}
\frac{2\pi hc^{2} \lambda^{-5} \varepsilon_{S}}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda kT_{G}}}-1} = \frac{2\pi hc^{2} \lambda^{-5}\delta^{-1}}{e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda kT_{B}}}-1}.
\label{equ:ctGreyBody2}
\end{equation}
Then solving Equation \ref{equ:ctGreyBody2} for T$_{G}$, yields the formula			

\begin{equation}
T_{G}=\frac{hc}{\lambda k \ln{ \left[ \varepsilon_{S} \delta \left( e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k T_{B}}} - 1\right) +1 \right]}}
\label{equ:ctGreyBody3}
\end{equation}
So by knowing the spectral emissivity for the wavelength which is passed by the pyrometer, the Fresnel correction, and the black body temperature, the gray body temperature can be found.

	A second way of determining the gray body temperature of a wire is by applying the law of conservation of energy. The wire is in a vacuum and energy put into the wire can only dissipate through electromagnetic radiation. As a result power in, P$_{in}$, equals power out, P$_{out}$.

	The power radiated by the wire is proportional to the radiance of the wire and the surface area of a wire. By assuming that the wire is cylindrical the output power should be

\begin{equation}
P_{out} = I_{Total} \pi d L,
\label{equ:ctPowerOut}
\end{equation}
where  I$_{Total}$ is the total radiated intensity, L is the length of the wire, and d is the diameter of the wire. The tungsten filament in the quartz halogen lamp used in this experiment has a diameter of 7x10$^{-5}$ m $\pm$ 5x10$^{-6}$ m and a length of 0.63 m $\pm$ 0.01 m. The total intensity can be determined by adding up the intensity radiated at each wavelength. This is the same as integrating Equation \ref{equ:ctPlanckDistributionEquation2} over all wavelengths. By doing this it can be shown that 

\begin{equation}
I_{Total} = \sigma T_{B}^{4},
\label{equ:ctIntensityTotal}
\end{equation}
which is known as the {\bf Stefan-Boltzmann law}, and $\sigma$ is the {\bf Stefan-Boltzmann constant}. By applying Equation \ref{equ:ctGreyBody} to Equation \ref{equ:ctIntensityTotal} the Stefan-Boltzmann law can be written as

\begin{equation}
I_{Total} = \varepsilon_{{\scriptscriptstyle T}} \sigma T_{G}^{4},
\label{equ:ctIntensityTotal2}
\end{equation}
where the total emissivity is used because the expression is dealing with the total intensity radiated. The total emissivity for tungsten is given by

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{T}(T_{G}) = -3.4481x10^{-8}T_{{\scriptscriptstyle G}}^{2} + 2.5000x10^{-4}T_{G}-1.0484x10^{-1},
\label{equ:ctTotalEmissivity}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_{T}$ is the total emissivity as a function of the gray body temperature. By substituting Equation \ref{equ:ctIntensityTotal2} into Equation \ref{equ:ctPowerOut} the power out becomes

\begin{equation}
P_{out} = \varepsilon_{{\scriptscriptstyle T}} \sigma T_{G}^{4} \pi d L.
\label{equ:ctPowerOut2}
\end{equation}
	
	The power input into the wire is

\begin{equation}
P_{in} = i^{2}R,
\label{equ:ctPowerOut3}
\end{equation}
where i is the current flowing through the wire, and R is the resistance of the wire. It is known that the resistance of a wire is proportional to its length, and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. The resistance of a wire also increases with an increase in temperature. The wire resistance can be written as

\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\rho L}{A},
\label{equ:ctResistance}
\end{equation}
where A is the cross-sectional area of the filament and $\rho$ = $\rho$(T$_{G}$) is the {\bf resistivity} of the wire. Resistivity is a function of the gray body temperature and is given by
 
\begin{equation}
\rho(T_{G}) = 1.7993x10^{-14}T_{G}^{2} + 2.6359x10^{-10}T_{G}-3.2316x10^{-8},
\label{equ:ctResistivity}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ has units of $\Omega$m. By substituting Equation \ref{equ:ctResistance} into Equation \ref{equ:ctPowerOut3} and assuming that the cross-section of the wire is a circle, of diameter d, P$_{in}$ becomes 

\begin{equation}
P_{in} = \frac{4i^{2} \rho L}{\pi d^{2}}.
\label{equ:ctPowerIn}
\end{equation}
Equating the power into the wire with power out of the wire yields

\begin{equation}
\frac{4i^{2} L}{\pi d^{2}} = \varepsilon_{{\scriptscriptstyle T}} \sigma T_{G}^{4} \pi d L.
\label{equ:ctPowerIn2}
\end{equation}
Finally by rearranging Equation \ref{equ:ctPowerIn2}, the expression

\begin{equation}
\frac{i^{2}}{d^{3}} = \frac{\varepsilon_{{\scriptscriptstyle T}} \sigma \pi^{2} T_{G}^{4}}{4 \rho},
\label{equ:ctPowerIn3}
\end{equation}
is obtained. Equation \ref{equ:ctPowerIn3} suggests that the wire temperature can be deduced from the wire diameter and the current flowing through it. If a plot of $\frac{i^{2}}{d^{3}}$ versus $\frac{\varepsilon_{T} \pi^{2} T_{G}^{4}}{4 \rho}$ produces a graph with a slope that is within error of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant then it can be concluded that both methods of measuring the temperature of the wire are valid. 

	Colour temperature relates the colour of an object to its temperature. It seems reasonable to expect that it is possible to reverse the procedure and calculate the colour of an object given its temperature. In order to calculate the colour of an object, colours must be represented numerically. The study of colour and the eye has revealed how colours, or rather colours as the eye perceives them, can be reproduced. The human eye uses what is known as {\bf cones} to see colours. There are three types of cones in the eye. One that is sensitive to spectral light of short wavelengths, one that is sensitive to medium wavelengths, and one that is sensitive to longer wavelengths. When light reaches a cone each wave will stimulate the cones according to its wavelength. The closer the wavelength is to a cone's maximum sensitivity, the greater stimulation it will cause. A signal is then sent to the brain, where the brain compares the intensities of the signals from the three different types of cones to determine what colour is being seen. Two colours are perceived to be the same colour if they have the same effect on the eye. This means that the colours do not need to be comprised of the exact same wavelengths with the exact same intensity, but rather the amount that each type of cone is stimulated by the two sources must be the same. 

	David Wright (1906-1997) and John Guild tested a large number of subjects to examine how humans perceive colours in terms of three primary colour functions. The results were used to create three plots known as {\bf color matching functions}. The CIE (Commission Internationale de L'Eclariage) {\bf standard observer} colour matching functions are denoted by x$_{CIE}(\lambda)$, y$_{CIE}(\lambda)$, and z$_{CIE}(\lambda)$, and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ctColorMatchingFunctions}. These functions describe how much effect each wavelength has on the perception of colour by humans.

  \caption{Color matching functions}
  \label{fig:ctColorMatchingFunctions}
\end{figure}



	The primary colour intensities needed to reproduce a colour requires the knowledge of the colour's actual intensity spectrum, which can be determined experimentally. One example of a such a function is Planck's distribution  equation for a black body at a given temperature. Let I($\lambda$) be the spectrum of a colourful object. Using the colour matching functions, the human perceived colour of the spectrum I($\lambda$) is given by three {\bf tristimulus} values X, Y, and Z given by the expressions		

\begin{equation}
X=\int\limits_{\lambda = 0}^{\lambda = \infty}I(\lambda)x_{CIE}(\lambda) d \lambda,
\label{equ:ctCIE}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Y=\int\limits_{\lambda = 0}^{\lambda = \infty}I(\lambda)y_{CIE}(\lambda) d \lambda,
\label{equ:ctCIE2}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
Z=\int\limits_{\lambda = 0}^{\lambda = \infty}I(\lambda)z_{CIE}(\lambda) d \lambda,
\label{equ:ctCIE3}
\end{equation}
In practice these integrals are often approximated as summations of the form
				
\begin{equation}
X \approx \sum\limits_{\lambda = 380\ nm}^{\lambda = 780\ nm}I(\lambda)x_{CIE}(\lambda) \Delta \lambda,
\label{equ:ctCIE4}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Y \approx \sum\limits_{\lambda = 380\ nm}^{\lambda = 780\ nm}I(\lambda)y_{CIE}(\lambda) \Delta \lambda,
\label{equ:ctCIE5}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
Z \approx \sum\limits_{\lambda = 380\ nm}^{\lambda = 780\ nm}I(\lambda)z_{CIE}(\lambda) \Delta \lambda,
\label{equ:ctCIE6}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \lambda$ is the interval at which the colour matching functions were determined, usually 1 nm or 5 nm. Using this method, the colour of any perceived spectrum can be calculated as the triplet XYZ. The full range of colours visible to the average human eye lies inside the three dimensional XYZ {\bf color space}.

	To make the XYZ colour space easier to visualize, the colour information is separated from the brightness information. This is done by normalizing XYZ using the expressions

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{X}{X+Y+Z}\ ,
\label{equ:ctCIE7}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
y = \frac{Y}{X+Y+Z}\ ,
\label{equ:ctCIE8}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
z = \frac{Z}{X+Y+Z}\ .
\label{equ:ctCIE9}
\end{equation}
Note that the by adding Equations \ref{equ:ctCIE7}, \ref{equ:ctCIE8}, and \ref{equ:ctCIE9} together that it can be shown that 

\begin{equation}
z = 1-x-y,
\label{equ:ctZ}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{equ:ctCIE9} and z can therefore be discarded. This leaves behind the xy colour space which is a representation of all perceived colours independent of their brightness. Figure \ref{fig:ctChromaticityDiagram} is a picture of all the colours in the xy plane, and is known as a {\bf chromaticity diagram}. Colours corresponding to the visually perceived colour of a black body must also appear on the chromaticity diagram. Each different temperature corresponds to a different colour. A plot of blackbody colour versus blackbody temperature appears on the chromaticity diagram as a curve called the {\bf Planckian locus}.

\end{figure}

	If an expression for the Planckian locus were known, then it would be possible to calculate the perceived colour of a blackbody with a given temperature. Although analytical, formulae for the Planckian locus are not possible, empirical formulae are commonly used instead. The empirical formulae are obtained by fitting functions to the Planckian locus in the xy chromaticity space. The x chromaticity can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\resizebox{.9\hsize}{!}{$\frac{1}{x} = -0.053895 \ln({T_{B})}^{4} + 1.5488 \ln({T_{B}})^{3} - 16.225 \ln({T_{B}})^{2} + 73.697 \ln({T_{B}}) - 121.12$},
\label{equ:ctInverseX}
\end{equation}
for 1 000 K $\leq$ T$_{B}$ $\leq$ 10 000 K and

\begin{equation}
\resizebox{.9\hsize}{!}{$\frac{1}{x} = -0.014663 \ln({T_{B})}^{4} + 0.65589 \ln({T_{B}})^{3} - 11.047 \ln({T_{B}})^{2} + 83.107 \ln({T_{B}}) - 231.71$},
\label{equ:ctInverseX2}
\end{equation}
for 10 000 K $\leq$ T$_{B}$ $\leq$ 50 000 K. Similarly, the y chromaticity can be expressed as 

\begin{equation}
\resizebox{.9\hsize}{!}{$\frac{1}{y} = -0.081937 \ln({T_{B})}^{4} + 2.4442 \ln({T_{B}})^{3} - 26.538 \ln({T_{B}})^{2} + 123.55 \ln({T_{B}}) - 203.31$},
\label{equ:ctInverseY}
\end{equation}
for 1 000 K $\leq$ T$_{B}$ $\leq$ 10 000 K and

\begin{equation}
\resizebox{.9\hsize}{!}{$\frac{1}{y} = 0.0031207 \ln({T_{B})}^{4} - 0.072 \ln({T_{B}})^{3} + 0.0867 \ln({T_{B}})^{2} + 7.7666 \ln({T_{B}}) - 41.626$},
\label{equ:ctInverseY2}
\end{equation}
for 10 000 K $\leq$ T$_{B}$ $\leq$ 50 000 K. \\

	Further transformations are required to convert perceived colours in xy space into colours that can be displayed on a video screen or computer monitor. The standard colour space used in computers and video is called {\bf sRGB}, which denotes the standard Red, Green, Blue phosphors used to display colours on a screen. To display the colour of a black body on a screen it is therefore necessary to convert an xy colour on the Planckian locus into the corresponding colour in sRGB space. The procedure for this is as follows.

	Equation \ref{equ:ctZ} is used to recover z from x and y. Then rgb can be found using the linear transformation

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} r \\ g \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3.242979 & -1.538336 & -0.498920 \\ -0.968998 & 1.875492 & 0.041545 \\ 0.055668 & -0.204117 & 1.057698 \end{bmatrix}.
\label{equ:ctRGMMatrix}
\end{equation}
If any of the r, g, and b values are less than 0 then that particular colour cannot be displayed on a standard RGB monitor. This is called an {\bf out of gamut} colour. 

On other hand, if the r, g, and b can be displayed, then they are normalized to obtain the sRGB value. Let m be the largest of r, g, and b. Then sRGB is given by

\begin{equation}
R = \frac{r}{m}, \ \ \ \ \ G = \frac{g}{m}, \ \ \ \ \ B = \frac{b}{m}.
\label{equ:ctRGMNormalized}
\end{equation}
Lastly, many computer applications specify sRGB values as integers. Typically, computers can display 256$^{3}$ different colours. This sRGB discrete colour space is given by multiplying R, G, and B by 255 and then taking only the integer parts.

  \caption{Experimental Setup}
  \label{fig:ctExperimentalSetup}
\end{figure}


	Figure \ref{fig:ctExperimentalSetup} shows the experimental set up that will be used to measure the temperature of a quartz halogen lamp filament using the colour temperature method, and eventually determine the sRGB values for some colour temperatures. 

	The {\bf AC current probe} measures the current flowing through a wire by taking advantage of the fact that a current creates a magnetic field that is proportional to the magnitude of the current. The magnetic field induces a current in the probe which is measured by the ammeter. The cord for the quartz halogen lamp contains two wires. The two wires carry current in opposite directions causing the magnetic fields to cancel out. To avoid this an {\bf AC line separator} is used to separate the two wires so that the probe can be clamped around only one wire.  

\section{{\bf Experimental Procedure}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Attach the long threaded mounting rod to the bottom of the pyrometer and secure the rod in a bench clamp so that the eyepiece of the pyrometer is close to the end of the table, and can easily be looked into by someone seated at the end of the table. Secure the quartz halogen flood lamp in the second bench clamp. Place the second bench clamp about 35 cm away from the pyrometer bench clamp. 
\item Plug the halogen flood lamp into the wire separator and plug the separator into the variac. Clip the AC transformer into the loop of the separator that reads x1 and plug the current probe connector into the multimeter mA and common plugs. Note that the current probe connector has a small tab with the label GND. This plug should be inserted into the common plug. Also note that the current read off of the multimeter is 10$^{3}$ times smaller than the actual current. For example, when using the AC current probe, a reading of 0.375 mA corresponds to an actual current of 375 mA.   
\item Turn on the quartz halogen lamp, and set the voltage to approximately 25 volts. Ensure that the range selector on the pyrometer is set to 'L'. Look through the pyrometer and adjust its position until a bright light can be seen. Adjust the reference focus until the wire comes into sharp focus, and adjust the source focus until the tungsten filament comes into sharp focus. Press the reference wire switch and adjust the reference wire current until the wire inside the pyrometer can be seen to glow red. Re-adjust the position of the pyrometer until the wire is superimposed on the filament in the lamp. 
\item Adjust the reference wire current until the wire and the filament appear to be the same brightness. When the two bodies are of the same brightness the reference wire should appear to merge into the filament at all points where the two bodies intercept. Practice taking measurements at this voltage until results become consistent. Note that pyrometer readings should be taken from the scale that matches that of the range selector on the end of the pyrometer (L, H, xH) and that the temperature the pyrometer measures temperatures is in $^{\circ}$C and must be converted to K.
\item The relationship between current and graybody temperature of tungsten as predicted by Equation \ref{equ:ctPowerIn3} can be tested. Reduce the voltage to 15 volts and begin to make temperature measurements of the filament at increments of 5-10 volts from 15-140 volts. Record the temperature, current, voltage (as read off of the variac), and range. If when making a measurement the reference wire is past the maximum calibrated temperature simply, switch the range selector to a higher range. Refocus the source focus and continue making measurements. 
\item The connection between colour and temperature would suggest that if a colour, corresponding to a specific temperature, is reproduced and then looked at with the pyrometer, that the temperature measured by the pyrometer should agree with the temperature used to calculate that colour. Enter the R, G, and B values calculated in the pre-lab into a painting program that can create custom colours. Make a large rectangle of this colour on a computer monitor, look at it with the pyrometer and make a colour temperature measurement of this colour. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{{\bf Error Analysis}}

The error in the pyrometer changes depending of the range in which it is operating. When in the 'L' range take the error to be 4$^\circ C$, when in 'H' or in 'xH' take it to be 8$^\circ C$. Take the error in the current as listed on the bottom of the multimeter, and the variac as exact. Assume the equations for emissivity and resistivity given as exact. Use standard error propagation methods to determine the error in the corrected temperature and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Sources of error not taken into account include differences in diameter along the wire, the bandwidth of the 653 nm colour filter, and the light reflected by the back of the lamp.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

	To investigate the interaction between gamma ray photons and electrons in matter. To get experience with nuclear particle detectors. To observe and explore gamma ray spectroscopy.

\section{Theory}

	The fundamental ability to see things is based on the interaction of light with matter. One of the common ways that light interacts with matter is called \textbf{scattering}. Scattering is the name given to processes that alter the direction in which light is travelling. Depending upon the type of scattering, other properties of the light such as the frequency can also be changed. It is common knowledge that visibility is much poorer in the fog than when it is clear. One reason this happens is because the water droplets making up the fog scatter the light so that the direction is randomized. The original scene is first hazy and then obscured completely as the fog becomes denser. Rainbows, the blue sky, and the red sky at sunset all arise because of light scattering. Dozens of different kinds of light scattering modes are now known.
 
	Gamma radiation is a high energy form of light, so it follows that it too can be scattered. In fact, at high energies new types of scattering appear that are not observable at lower energies. One such new type of scattering is known as \textbf{Compton scattering}. Here, instead of scattering off of water droplets, the gamma rays scatter from the outer valence electrons in the atoms themselves. The phenomenon of Compton scattering helped solidify the theory that light is quantized and emitted as small massless packets called \textbf{photons}.

	In the early part of the twentieth century, it was well established that light is an electromagnetic wave. However, evidence was beginning to mount that suggested that light also consisted of photons. The prevailing electromagnetic theory predicted that light scattering from electrons should only change frequency depending on the time the electron was exposed to light  and on the light intensity. The American physicist Arthur Compton (1892-1962) gathered evidence that showed this did not happen. Instead, the scattered light changed frequency only with the scattering angle. Compton then proceeded to explain his results theoretically using special relativity and the quantum theory of light.

	For this experimental and theoretical work, Compton was awarded the 1927 Nobel prize in physics. Additionally, it was Compton who originally coined the term \textit{photon}, for a quantum of light. With the discovery and explanation of Compton scattering, many lingering doubts that physicists had about quantum theory and special relativity were dispelled. It is now accepted that special relativity holds true and that light has both wave and particle properties. Special relativity and light wave particle duality are topics that are still under active investigation today.

	Suppose that a beam of gamma rays falls on some target. Following Compton, assume the gamma rays consist of photons, each with initial momentum $p_i$ and initial energy $E_i$, where 

\begin{equation}
E_i = hf_i = p_ic
\label{equ:csEnergy}
\end{equation}

with $h = 6.62606876\times10^{-34}\ J\cdot s$ being Planck's constant, and $c = 299792458\ m/s$ is the speed of light in a vacuum. So each photon has energy and momentum in proportion to its frequency. Further assume that Compton scattering is due to an elastic collision between a gamma ray photon and a stationary free electron.

  \label{fig:csCollision}
  \caption{Photon-electron collision}
\end{figure}

	In this case, the electron struck by the photon is initially at rest and both energy and linear momentum are conserved. So this situation can be treated like the billiard ball collision depicted in Figure \ref{fig:csCollision}. After impact the photon has lost some energy and momentum to the electron. The scattered photon leaves the collision at angle $\theta$ with energy $E_s$ and momentum $p_s$. The electron leaves the collision at recoil angle $\phi$ with momentum $p_e$ and kinetic energy $K_e$.

	By conservation of momentum, the electron must have gained the momentum the photon lost so the electron momentum is

\begin{equation}
\vec{p_e} = \vec{p_i} - \vec{p_s}
\label{equ:csMomentum}
\end{equation}

Similarly, the kinetic energy of the electron is

\begin{equation}
K_e = E_i - E_s
\label{equ:csKineticEnergy}
\end{equation}

	It is the scattered gamma rays that are of interest here since they can be detected after leaving the target. This happens because gamma rays are penetrating whereas electrons are not. So eliminating the angle $\phi$ and using conservation of momentum yields the formula

\begin{equation}
p_e^2 = p_i ^2 + p_s^2 - 2p_ip_scos\theta
\label{equ:csConservationMomentum}
\end{equation}

In this experiment the energy of the scattered gamma rays are examined, so the momenta in Equation \ref{equ:csConservationMomentum} need to be converted to energies. Multiplying both sides of Equation \ref{equ:csConservationMomentum} by $c^2$ and substituting Equation \ref{equ:csEnergy} yields

\begin{equation}
p_e^2c^2 = E_i ^2 + E_s^2 - 2E_iE_scos\theta
\label{equ:csConservationEnergy}
\end{equation}

To eliminate $p_e$, Compton used the \textbf{relativistic energy momentum relationship} for the electron which is

\begin{equation}
p_e^2c^2 = K_e^2 + 2m_ec^2K_e
\label{equ:csRelEnergyMomentum}
\end{equation}

where $m_ec^2$ is the \textbf{rest mass energy} of the electron. Substituting Equations \ref{equ:csRelEnergyMomentum} and \ref{equ:csKineticEnergy} into Equation \ref{equ:csConservationEnergy} gives the result

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{E_S}-\frac{1}{E_i}=\frac{1}{m_ec^2}(1-cos\theta)
\label{equ:csConservationEnergySub}
\end{equation}

Using Equation \ref{equ:csEnergy} to convert the energy of the photons to their wavelength gives

\begin{equation}
\lambda_s - \lambda_i = \Delta \lambda = \frac{h}{m_ec}(1-cos\theta)
\label{equ:csScattering}
\end{equation}

which is \textbf{Compton's scattering formula}. This formula predicts that a scattered photon undergoes a wavelength change dependent only on the scattering angle and that the maximum change happens at an angle of 180$\ \degree$. The wavelength change is independent of the incoming wavelength, which means that the same magnitude of wavelength shift happens for visible light as for x-rays or gamma rays. For example, at a scattering angle of 60$\ \degree$, the Compton scattering formula predicts a change in wavelength of 1.2 pm (picometers). For visible red light with a wavelength of 600 nm (nanometers) this change is nearly invisible. However, gamma radiation with an energy of 600 keV has a wavelength of 2 pm. At this wavelength, a shift of 1.2 pm is a 60$\%$ change which is easily detected. It is for this reason that gamma rays are often used to examine Compton scattering.

  \caption{Experimental Apparatus}
\end{figure}

	In this experiment, the source used is caesium-137 which emits gamma rays with an energy of 661.66 keV. The experimental apparatus is shown in Figure \ref{fig:csApparatus}. The caesium pellet at (a) is enclosed in a shielded box (b) except for a conical aperture at (c). A gamma ray beam (d) is emitted from the box through the aperture and strikes the rod (e). The gamma rays undergo Compton scattering from electrons in the rod. The Compton formula predicts that scattered gamma rays (f) will be emitted from the rod at a wide range of angles up to and including 180$\ \degree$. A movable assembly (i) observes the scattered gamma rays at some particular angle  though the entrance aperture (g) with the gamma ray detector (h).

	The Compton scattering formula predicts the energy of the gamma rays emitted from the rod at a particular angle. However, it does not predict the \textbf{number} of gamma rays that are emitted at each angle. If the number turns out to be small then Compton scattering would not be readily observable even if the effect was real. Fortunately, it turns out that the number of gamma rays at each angle is indeed significant, so the Compton scattering effect is predicted to be readily observable with gamma rays. The actual population of scattered gamma rays at various angles is determined by a quantity called the \textbf{nuclear cross-section}.

	The nuclear cross-section, $\sigma$, is the \textbf{effective area presented by the target} of an interaction. In the macroscopic world a target has one particular area. However, in nuclear cross-sections the area of an object is not well defined, and the probability of an interaction extends over a diffuse region centered on a neighbourhood of the object but usually larger. Nevertheless, in nuclear cross-sections, as with macroscopic targets, the larger the cross section, the easier it is to hit the target. For this reason, the unit of nuclear cross-section is named a \textbf{barn} (from the expression to hit the broadside of a barn). One barn (b) has an area of $10^{-28}\ m^2$. The nuclear cross-section for Compton scattering is denoted by $\sigma_c$.

	For Compton scattering the target is an electron and the interaction is the scattering of a gamma ray at one particular scattering angle. Classically, the nuclear cross-section of an electron would be the cross-sectional area of the electron. This value is taken to be the square of the \textbf{classical electron radius}, $r_e = 2.81794\times10^{-15}\ m$. Since the electron is not really a discrete fixed target and the gamma ray photon interacts with it in a probabilistic manner, the Compton scattering cross-section has to take quantum mechanics into account. So the nuclear cross-section is expected to be $r_e^2$ multiplied by a quantum correction factor that depends on the scattering angle. The cross-section for Compton scattering derived from quantum theory is

\begin{equation}
\sigma_c = \frac{r_e^2}{2} \left(\frac{E_s}{E_i}\right)^2 \left[\frac{E_i}{E_s} + \frac{E_s}{E_i} - sin^2\theta \right]
\label{equ:csCrossSection}
\end{equation}

The Compton scattering formula can be used to eliminate $E_i$ and $E_s$ from Equation \ref{equ:csCrossSection}. Rewriting Equation \ref{equ:csConservationEnergySub} in ratio form gives

\begin{equation}
\frac{E_i}{E_s}=1+\alpha(1-cos\theta)
\label{equ:csConservationRatio}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the ratio of the incoming gamma ray energy ($E_i$) to the electron rest mass energy ($m_ec^2$). In this experiment $\alpha$ has the value 1.295. Substituting this into Equation \ref{equ:csCrossSection} yields the expression

\begin{equation}
\sigma_c = \frac{r_e^2}{2} \left[ \frac{1+cos^2\theta}{[1+\alpha(1-cos\theta)]^2}\right]\left[1 + \frac{\alpha^2(1-cos\theta)^2}{(1+cos^2\theta) [1+\alpha(1-cos\theta)]}\right]
\label{equ:csKleinNishina}
\end{equation}

This is called the \textbf{Klein-Nishina formula} for the nuclear cross-section of Compton scattering in honour of the two physicists who first derived this expression in 1929. Although it appears complicated, it really only is the classical cross section of the electron multiplied by a single constant that happens to depend on the scattering angle and on the initial gamma ray energy.

	Once found, the Compton scattering cross-section can be used to predict the number of gamma rays that are scattered into each scattering angle. Alternatively, the count rate at a particular scattering angle versus the incoming gamma ray count rate can be used to determine the measured Compton scattering cross-section. Either way, the cross section relates the outgoing scattered gamma rays to the incoming gamma rays.

	However, usually the target is a piece of material containing a large number of electrons rather than one electron. Furthermore, the incoming gamma rays bombard an area of the target, not just a single point. Lastly, gamma ray detectors only observe gamma rays in a particular solid angle and with a given efficiency. Many scattered gamma rays escape uncounted. These extra parameters must be corrected for when measuring the scattering cross-section.

	Suppose that $F_b$ is the \textbf{flux} of bombarding gamma rays striking the target (flux is the count rate per unit area), $C_d$ is the count rate of scattered gamma rays observed by the detector at angle $\theta$, $N_e$ is the number of electrons irradiated in the target, $\Omega$ is the solid angle intercepted by the detector, and E is the \textbf{efficiency} with which the detector observes the gamma rays. Then the Compton scattering cross-section is the ratio of scattered gamma rays to incoming gamma ray flux multiplied by a correction for the number of electrons, detector solid angle, and efficiency. This yields the formula

\begin{equation}
\sigma_c = \frac{C_d}{F_b}\cdot\frac{1}{N_eE\Omega}
\label{equ:csCrossSectionCorrection}
\end{equation}

	Equation \ref{equ:csCrossSectionCorrection} can be used to measure the scattering cross-section, which can then be compared with the theoretical value predicted by the Klein-Nishina formula. An inspection of Equation \ref{equ:csCrossSectionCorrection} and Figure \ref{fig:csApparatus} suggests that nearly all of the quantities are fixed values determined by the geometry and materials of the apparatus. The flux of gamma rays striking the target is determined by the count rate of the gamma source pellet, $C_{\gamma}$, and the distance from the source to the target ($r_s$ = 0.343 m). The flux striking the target is the source count rate divided by the surface area of the entire sphere at the radius of the target. So

\begin{equation}
F_b = \frac{C_{\gamma}}{4\pi r_s^2} = \frac{C_{\gamma}}{4\pi\cdot(0.343\ m)^2} = C_{\gamma}\times(6.7640\times10^{-1})\ m^{-2}
\label{equ:csFlux}
\end{equation}

The target is a cylindrical rod with a diameter of 0.0127 m. It has been established that the bombarding gamma ray beam intercepts the target over a height of 0.074 m. The number of electrons in a cylindrical target of volume V made of a pure element with atomic number Z, atomic mass A, and density $\rho$ is

\begin{align}
N_e &= \frac{N_A\rho VZ}{A} \\
&= \frac{\rho Z}{A}(6.022\times10^{23}\ atom/mol)\left(\frac{0.0127\ m}{2}\right)^2(0.074\ m\pi) \\
&= \frac{\rho Z}{A}(5.6452\times10^{18})\ m^3/mol
\label{equ:csNumElectrons}
\end{align}

where $N_A=6.022142\times10^{23}$ atoms per mole is \textbf{Avogadro's constant}. The solid angle over which the detector observes gamma rays is determined by the area of the detector, $A_d$ and the distance from the target to the detector, $r_d$. The detector crystal is a disk 0.0254 m in diameter at a distance of $r_d = 0.343$ $m$ from the target rod. The solid angle is the detector area divided by the square of the distance so

\begin{equation}
\Omega = \pi\left(\frac{0.0254\ m}{2}\right)^2\cdot\frac{1}{(0.343\ m)^2}=4.3069\times10^{-3}
\label{equ:csSolidAngle}
\end{equation}

	Lastly, the detector crystal used to observe the scattered gamma rays is not 100$\%$ efficient at detecting them. As the gamma energy increases, the photons become more penetrating and the probability that the photon passes completely through the detector increases. The efficiency of the detector is given by the empirically derived power law

\begin{equation}
E = 16.0E_s^{-0.55}
\label{equ:csDetectorEfficiency}
\end{equation}

where $E_s$ is the scattered gamma ray energy in keV. This formula is valid for gamma ray energies between 180 keV and 680 keV and detector crystals 0.0254 m in diameter. For example, at 600 keV the detector has an efficiency of 0.49. At this energy, less than half the gamma rays are picked up by the detector.

	Collecting the constants together gives the final result that

\begin{equation}
\sigma_c = (6.0806\times10^{-17})\ \frac{mol}{m}\left(\frac{1}{C_{\gamma}}\right)\left(\frac{A}{\rho Z}\right)\left(\frac{C_d}{E}\right)
\label{equ:csCrossSectionFinal}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:csCrossSectionFinal} shows that the Compton scattering cross-section depends on the source count rate, the target material, and the efficiency corrected scattered count rate. This formula can be used to experimentally measure the cross-section or predict the count rate at different angles.

	The detector records the arrival and energy of the scattered gamma ray photons. To be recorded, the gamma ray must interact with the detector material. The full energy of the gamma ray is only recorded when the gamma ray is entirely absorbed inside the detector. In an ideal detector, this absorption happens for each and every gamma ray that intercepts the detector. In this case a plot of the detector output, called the \textbf{energy spectrum}, would look like Figure \ref{fig:csIdealSpectrum}. The only energy at which counts are recorded is at the scattering energy $E_s$. The only feature visible in the energy spectrum is the \textbf{full energy peak} or \textbf{photopeak} corresponding to the energy of the scattered gamma rays emitted from the target.

\label{fig:csIdealSpectrum}
\end{marginfigure}
	The ideal energy spectrum displayed in Figure \ref{fig:csIdealSpectrum} only appears when the detector is large enough to absorb all the gamma rays that enter. In practice, such detectors are seldom used because of their expense and fragility. For smaller detectors, such as the one used in this experiment, much of the energy appears elsewhere in the energy spectrum because the incoming gamma ray is partly absorbed and the remaining fraction escapes the detector.

	The primary interaction by which the detector material absorbs incoming gamma rays is also Compton scattering. Inside the detector, the gamma ray strikes an electron and the recoil electron is quickly absorbed, taking away some of the energy. The remaining energy is carried away by the scattered gamma ray which can undergo further Compton scattering or escape from the detector completely. If the scattered gamma ray escapes from the detector the full energy $E_s$ will not be recorded and only some fraction appears on the energy spectrum instead.

	In the lower limit of $0\ \degree$ scattering, the gamma ray carrying all the energy escapes and the recoil electron has no energy at all. At the upper limit, the most energy a gamma ray can lose at one time from Compton scattering is at an angle of $180\ \degree$, where the incoming gamma ray strikes the electron head-on and the scattered gamma ray is bounced completely backwards. In this case the recoil electron gets the maximum energy which is subsequently deposited into the detector. This process of scattered gamma rays escaping from the detector gives rise to a band of energies ranging from zero to some maximum value in the energy spectrum. This band is called the \textbf{Compton continuum}. The maximum value of this continuum, corresponding to the escape of a $180\ \degree$ scattered gamma ray, is called the \textbf{Compton edge}. Some of the scattered gamma rays undergo \textbf{multiple Compton interactions}. This tends to fill in the region between the photopeak and the Compton edge. Figure \ref{fig:csRealSpectrum} shows a more realistic gamma ray energy spectrum with a photopeak, Compton continuum, Compton edge, and multiple Compton interactions.

	The energy of the Compton edge, $E_c$, is the incoming energy $E_s$ less the energy, $E_{180\ \degree}$, of a $180\ \degree$ scattered gamma ray that has escaped. Using Equation \ref{equ:csConservationEnergySub} to find $E_{180\ \degree}$ gives the result

\begin{equation}
E_c = E_s - E_{180\ \degree} = E_s - \frac{E_s}{1+\frac{2E_s}{m_ec^2}} = \frac{2E_s^2}{m_ec^2+2E_s}
\label{equ:csEdgeEnergy}
\end{equation}

	The energy spectrum displays several other notable features. caesium-137 actually decays by beta decay, thereby emitting an electron. The beta particles are absorbed by the intervening air and the target and so do not affect the experiment. However, after emitting an electron, often (92$\%$ of the time), the resulting isotope, barium-137, remains in an excited state denoted as Ba$^{137}$. This excited state quickly decays (the half-life is 2.3 minutes) and emits the 661.66 keV gamma ray used in this experiment. Instead of emitting a gamma ray, a barium  electron near the nucleus can be given this energy instead, which changes its orbit. Then the remaining electrons reshuffle, and a K-shell x-ray is emitted. For Ba$^{137}$ this K-shell x-ray has an energy of 31.45 keV. This x-ray can appear as a photopeak at the low end of the energy spectrum.

	The shielding surrounding the detector also contributes features to the energy spectrum. Any materials with high atomic number will generate K-shell x-rays that can be seen by the detector if they are struck with gamma radiation. Since the detector is surrounded by lead, a lead K-shell xray of 72.14 keV frequently appears. In addition, besides happening inside the target and inside the detector material, Compton scattering also occurs inside the shielding. The Compton scattered gamma rays emitted from the shielding are mostly at high angles between 135$\ \degree$ and 180$\ \degree$, which implies gamma rays of energy around 200 keV. The feature that appears in the spectrum due to Compton scattering in the shielding is called the \textbf{backscatter peak}. These features are shown in Figure \ref{fig:csRealSpectrumMore}. The science of studying and interpreting spectra such as the one seen in Figure \ref{fig:csRealSpectrumMore} is known as \textbf{gamma ray spectroscopy}. This experiment presents several gamma ray spectra that can be checked for the presence of the features outlined in Figures \ref{fig:csIdealSpectrum}-\ref{fig:csRealSpectrumMore}.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do a warm up and performance check of the gamma detector system. The gamma detector has two housings. The small upright assembly is for calibration and testing. The larger horizontal movable assembly is used for the Compton scattering experiment itself. To begin, make sure the gamma detector is in the upright assembly. If the detector has to be moved, do it carefully because the gamma detector is fragile and expensive. First set the high voltage to 650 V and then turn on the high voltage power supply. After this, turn on the low voltage power supply (12, 24V). Once the power supplies are on, leave the detector to warm up and stabilize for about 15 minutes. While the detector is warming up turn on the computer and laser printer. The gamma ray acquisition program should appear once the computer has finished booting. Place the Cs$^{137}$ calibration disk under the detector and practice acquiring an energy spectrum. Set the horizontal scale to 1024 and the vertical scale to AUTO. Examine the energy spectrum and compare it with the examples seen in Figures \ref{fig:csIdealSpectrum}-\ref{fig:csRealSpectrumMore}. Observe the output signal from the detector on the oscilloscope. Each detected gamma ray is displayed as a negative pulse on the oscilloscope. The amplitude of the pulse represents the energy of the gamma ray photon. With no source under the detector, the pulses should be relatively rare. With the Cs$^{137}$ calibration disk under the detector, there should be large numbers of pulses.

\item Once the detector has warmed up, Perform an energy calibration of the gamma ray detector system. Begin by erasing the existing energy calibration. If this is not done, the new calibration values will not overwrite the current calibration, they will only distort the existing one. Three points are needed to establish a proper energy calibration and three small calibration sources are provided for this purpose. Use the caesium-137 photopeak at 661.66 keV for the first point. Use the highest energy barium-133 photopeak at 356.02 keV for the second point. Lastly, use the cobalt-57 photopeak at 122.06 keV for the third point.

\item \textbf{Safety precautions}: The 35 milliCurie caesium-137 source used in the Compton scattering apparatus is \textbf{dangerous}. Review the \textit{"Radiation Safety Information"} article at the beginning of the laboratory manual or obtain a copy from the lab instructor. The basic rule to follow is "\textbf{avoid the gamma ray beam}". Do NOT put any part of the body (notably hands and heads) in the path of the gamma ray beam. Stay \textbf{completely} out of the white painted area at all times when the gamma ray beam aperture is open. Handle the gamma ray stopper plug \textbf{only} by the extremities (the rings). Move the gamma ray detector assembly \textbf{only} by the magnets or the black knobs that are out of the white painted area. When changing the target rod, \textbf{always} close the gamma ray beam aperture first. Do \textbf{NOT} leave the apparatus unattended if the stopper is removed. Caution \textbf{anyone} entering the Compton scattering experiment area when the gamma ray beam is operational. \textbf{Always} plug the gamma ray beam with the stopper when the experiment is completed.

\item Following the precautions explained above, examine the main gamma ray source and make sure the gamma ray beam aperture is closed with the stopper plug. Place the detector into the horizontal shield assembly. Insert the aluminum target rod into the Compton scattering apparatus. Remove the stopper plug to enable the gamma ray beam (again, remember to follow the safety instructions). For at least eight angles ranging from 30$\ \degree$ to 130$\ \degree$ acquire a gamma ray spectrum and determine the energy of the scattered gamma ray photopeak. The scattering count rate decreases as the angle increases, so a longer acquisition time might be required to get a good spectrum. In practice, a live time of 600 seconds suffices for angles above $80\ \degree$.

\item Perform any \textbf{one} of the following investigations.\label{optionalSec}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For at least five angles, measure the scattering count rate and use it to find the Compton scattering cross-section, $\sigma_c$, using Equation \ref{equ:csCrossSectionFinal}. To get better results, measure the background count rate at each angle (count rate with target rod removed) and subtract it from the scattering count rate. Compare the measured cross-section with the theoretical Klein-Nishina cross-section predicted by Equation \ref{equ:csKleinNishina}.
    \item Equation \ref{equ:csCrossSectionFinal} suggests that the scattered count rate should be linear with the quantity ($\rho Z/A$) at any fixed scattering angle. Using the different target rods provided, design and implement an experiment to test this hypothesis.
    \item Measure the width, profile, and symmetry of the gamma ray beam. Measure $C_\gamma$ and compare it with the theoretically predicted value based on the  calculated count rate at the source and the solid angle of the detector. Determine whether the gamma ray beam is properly aligned with the $0$ axis by acquiring data on both sides of $0$.
    \item Design and implement an experiment to examine the Compton edge in the energy spectrum and compare it with the expected energy of the Compton edge predicted by Equation \ref{equ:csEdgeEnergy}.
    \item Equation \ref{equ:csConservationEnergySub} suggests that the scattered gamma ray energy $E_s$ is independent of the target material (as long as there are electrons in it). This suggests the hypothesis that the scattering energy at a fixed angle is independent of the scattering material. Design and implement an experiment to test this hypothesis using the available target rods.
    \item The upright detector stand has two different shields. One made from lead and one made from aluminum. Acquire a Caesium-137 spectrum with the lead shield and with the aluminum shield for the same amount of live time. Ask your laboratory instructor for hints on how to set up the instrument to acquire for a specific length of live time. Subtract the two spectra and examine the difference for evidence of a backscatter peak and a lead K-shell x-ray photopeak. The aluminum K-shell x-ray is too low in energy to be observed by the detector used in this experiment.
    \item Compton's scattering formula was derived using Equation \ref{equ:csRelEnergyMomentum}, which assumes the recoil electron energy momentum relationship follows special relativity. This feature can be used to test whether the recoil electron obeys classical mechanics or special relativity. Equation \ref{equ:csRelEnergyMomentum} can be rewritten in the form
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{p_e^2c^2}{K_e}=2m_ec^2+K_e
        \label{equ:csScatteringRewritten}
      \end{equation}
If the electron obeys classical mechanics the energy momentum relationship for the electron can be presented in the form
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{p_e^2c^2}{K_e}=2m_ec^2
        \label{equ:csScatteringClassical}
      \end{equation}
Equations \ref{equ:csScatteringRewritten} and \ref{equ:csScatteringClassical} imply that if the quantity $\frac{p_e^2c^2}{K_e}$ is plotted versus $K_e$, then the electron follows special relativity if a straight line of slope one is obtained, whereas if the electron behaves classically a straight line of slope zero is obtained. In both cases an intercept of $2m_ec^2$ is predicted. Compton scattering provides a means to test this assertion since $K_e$ is found from Equation \ref{equ:csKineticEnergy} and it can be shown that
      \begin{equation}
        \frac{p_e^2c^2}{K_e}=\frac{2E_iE_s(1-cos\theta)}{E_i-E_s}+E_i-E_s
        \label{equ:csScatteringRelativistic}
      \end{equation}
Design and implement an experiment to test whether the recoil electron obeys relativity or classical mechanics. Dividing by small numbers greatly magnifies errors. For this reason, use angles above 30$\ \degree$ so that the quantity $E_i-E_s$ is large.
    \item Compton scattering is quite useful for nondestructive testing of materials because the source and detector can both be on the same side of the material. Design and implement an experiment to investigate whether it is feasible to determine the target rod material simply by observing scattered gamma rays at a high angle (say above 120$\ \degree$).
\end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}
	The largest source of error in energy measurements of gamma rays is the spreading that occurs because of statistical variations inside the detector. This results in a peak appearance that is wide and rounded instead of narrow and sharp. A standard method of assigning error to a peak in a radiation spectrum is to use the \textbf{full width half maximum}, or \textbf{FWHM} as seen in Figure \ref{fig:csGaussian}.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Gaussian Distribution}
\label{fig:csGaussian}
\end{marginfigure}

	If an energy peak has height H, then the FWHM of a peak is the width of the peak at half height or H/2. The error in the energy of the peak, u(E), can be taken to be the standard deviation, $\sigma$, of the peak. For a Gaussian distribution this is given by
      \begin{equation}
        u(E) = \sigma = \frac{FWHM}{2.35}
        \label{equ:csGaussDist}
      \end{equation}
	Strictly speaking, most peaks are not Gaussian because peaks often overlap or are superimposed on some other background. Nevertheless, the FWHM technique is still a reasonable approximation for the error in the energy of the peak. The formal procedure is to subtract away the other peaks and the background so that the peak rides on a horizontal line as in Figure \ref{fig:csGaussian}. This procedure is not required for this experiment.

	The error in the count rate is determined from the statistics of counting events in the standard way. If C counts are detected in T seconds, then the count rate, R, is C/T with an error R given by
      \begin{equation}
        u(R) = \frac{\sqrt{C}}{T}
        \label{equ:csCountRateError}
      \end{equation}
	The gamma ray detector has a certain width so it accepts gamma rays from an interval of angles, not just one angle. For this apparatus the angular interval of the detector is about $4\degree$. A reasonable value for the angular error is half of the angular interval. So the error in the scattering angle, $u(\theta)$, is on the order of $2\ \degree$.

\section{{\bf Goals of the Experiment}}

To investigate magnetically induced optical activity. To determine the Verdet constant and the dispersion coefficient for a variety of optical media.

\section{{\bf Theory}}

First observed by Michael Faraday (1791-1867) in 1845, plane-polarized light propagating through a transparent material (such as glass, water or gas) along the direction of an applied magnetic field, experiences a rotation of its plane of polarization. Faraday's observation was one of the earliest indications of a relationship between electromagnetism and light. The theoretical treatment of the effect is complex, requiring the use of the quantum mechanical theory of dispersion and the effects of magnetic field on the atomic and molecular energy levels. The discussion of the effect here will be limited to a simplified classical argument (due to H.A.Lorentz, J.J.Larmor and A.E.Becquerel; 1896) in which the structure and spectra of atoms are not described in detail. The basic relationship between the angle of Faraday rotation, $\phi$ , the optical path length through the medium, $D$, and the applied magnetic field $B$ is linear 

\begin{equation}
\phi = V  B,
\label{equ:feFaradayRotation}%1
\end{equation}
where V is a constant of proportionality, called the Verdet constant.

	Consider a hydrogen atom with one electron in a circular orbit around the atomic nucleus. In the absence of a magnetic field, the electron is moving under the influence of a central, attractive, inverse-square force $F$

\begin{equation}
F = \frac{mv^{2}}{r} = 4 \pi^{2} f^{2} m r = m \omega^{2} r,
\label{equ:feForce}%2
\end{equation}
where $e$, $m$, $v$, $r$, $f$ and $\omega$ are the electron charge, mass, velocity, radius of orbit, frequency and angular velocity respectively. For very small changes in $F$, the above expression can be differentiated to obtain $dF$ which is 
				
\begin{equation}
dF = 8 \pi^{2} f m r \cdot df = 2mr \omega \cdot d \omega.
\label{equ:fedForce}%3
\end{equation}
The differential magnetic force acting on the orbital electron due to the application of an external magnetic field is 

\begin{equation}
dF = e v B = 2 \pi e B f r = e B r \omega.
\label{equ:fedForce2}%4
\end{equation}
Equating the above two differentials and solving for $d\omega$ gives				

\begin{equation}
d \omega = 2 \pi \cdot df = \frac{e B}{2 m}.
\label{equ:fedAngularVelocity}%5
\end{equation}

The quantity $d\omega$ is the angular frequency of precession of the electronic orbits, due to the influence of the applied magnetic field, also called the {\bf Larmor frequency}. It can be seen from Equation \ref{equ:fedAngularVelocity} that the Larmor frequency for a given particle is directly proportional to $B$, the intensity of the magnetic field (since the ratio $e/m$ is constant). The precession of electronic orbits is also applicable to atoms having a large number of orbital electrons or for complex molecules (for instance glass or organic compounds). Here, however, the classical model becomes inaccurate because of the electron to electron interactions.

Linearly polarized light can be thought of as the superposition (vector sum) of two circularly polarized component waves whose electric vectors (phasors) are, in the absence of a magnetic field, rotating at the same angular frequency, $\omega_{0}$, in opposite directions, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:feLinearlyPolarizedLight}. In an optical medium where the Larmor precession has been induced by the application of a magnetic field, the angular frequency of each circular wave will be different. Depending on the orientation of $B$ and the direction of wave propagation relative to it, the angular frequency of each circular wave will be as follows

\begin{equation}
\omega_{r} = \omega_{0} + d \omega
\label{equ:feAngularVelocityRight}%6
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
\omega_{l} = \omega_{0} - d \omega
\label{equ:feAngularVelocityLeft}%7
\end{equation}

Since $\omega_{l}\ < \ \omega_{r}$, the two circular waves emerge from the medium with a phase shift. This phase shift is caused by the velocity difference at which the two circular waves propagate through the medium (a change in $\omega$ translates into changes in velocity $v$ and refractive index $n$). In traversing a medium of length $D$ the electric vector $E$ of any circular wave rotates through an angle 

\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{2 \pi D}{\lambda}.
\label{equ:feRotationAngle}%8
\end{equation}
Using the relationships

\begin{equation}
n = \frac{c}{v}\ ,
\label{equ:feRelationship1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
v = f \lambda,
\label{equ:feRelationship2}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
c = f \lambda_{0}.
\label{equ:feRelationship3}
\end{equation}
where $c$ and $\lambda_{0}$ are the speed and wavelength of light in vacuum; $v$ and $\lambda$ are the speed and wavelength of light in a medium and $f$ is the frequency of light one obtains

\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{\lambda_{0}}{n},
\label{equ:feWavelength}%9
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
\theta = \frac{2 \pi D}{\lambda_{0}}n.
\label{equ:feRotationAngle2}%10
\end{equation}
Consequently, upon emerging from the optical medium, 

\begin{equation}
\theta_{r} = \frac{2 \pi D}{\lambda_{0}}n_{r}.
\label{equ:feRotationAngleRight}%11
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
\theta_{l} = \frac{2 \pi D}{\lambda_{0}}n_{l}.
\label{equ:feRotationAngleLeft}%12
\end{equation}
are the angles of rotation for the two circular vibrations. Here, $n_{r}$ and $n_{l}$ are the refractive indices for the right, and the left-circular vibrations respectively. The angle of Faraday rotation, $\phi$, is the angle through which the plane of polarization appears to have rotatated upon traversing the optically activated medium. It is one half the difference between $\theta_{r}$ and 
$\theta_{l}$. Figure \ref{fig:feCircularComponents} shows the left and right electric field components before and after traversing the optically activated medium. Using Equations \ref{equ:feRotationAngleRight} and \ref{equ:feRotationAngleLeft}, the angle of Faraday rotation is found to be

As explained above, refractive indices,$n_{r}$ and $n_{l}$, are different because of the Larmor precession. The slight variability of the refractive index with changing wavelength is referred to as {\bf dispersion}. Figure \ref{fig:feRefractiveIndex} shows a dispersion relationship typical for most types of glass. This relationship will be used to approximate the magnitude of ($n_{r}- n_{l}$) used in Equation \ref{equ:feFaradayRotation1}. Assuming that ($n_{r}- n_{l}$) is small, it can be approximated by the slope of the straight line tangent to the curve at the point ($\lambda_{0}$, $n$) multiplied by the width of the interval ($\lambda_{r} -\lambda_{l}$), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:feRefractiveIndex}. Thus ($n_{r}- n_{l}$) can be replaced by

\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \right)_{\lambda = \lambda_{0}} d \lambda.
\label{equ:fedn}%14
\end{equation}
The quantity $d\lambda$ is found to be

\begin{equation}
d \lambda = d \left( \frac{c}{f} \right) = - \frac{c}{f^{2}} d f = - \frac{\lambda^{2}}{c } d f = - \frac{\lambda^{2}}{2 \pi c } d \omega,
\label{equ:fedLambda}
\end{equation}
and $d\omega$ is given by Equation \ref{equ:fedAngularVelocity}. So we can write

\begin{equation}
(n_{r} - n_{l}) = \frac{\lambda_{0}^{2} e B}{2 \pi c m} \left( \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \right)_{\lambda = \lambda_{0}}.
\label{equ:fedn2}%15
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{equ:feFaradayRotation1} is then used to get

\begin{equation}
\phi = - \frac{e \lambda_{0}}{2 m c} \left( \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \right)_{\lambda = \lambda_{0}} D \cdot B,
\label{equ:fedFaradayRotation2}%16
\end{equation}
which is {\bf Becquerel's equation}. This can be written simply as $\phi = V D B$ where

\begin{equation}
V = - \frac{e \lambda_{0}}{2 m c} \left( \frac{d n}{d \lambda} \right)_{\lambda = \lambda_{0}},
\label{equ:fedFaradayRotation3}%17
\end{equation}
is the {\bf Verdet} constant. This yields Equation \ref{equ:feFaradayRotation}.

The experiment will test the validity of Equation \ref{equ:feFaradayRotation} in various optical media. Figure \ref{fig:feExperimentalSetup} shows the experimental apparatus. A laser beam of known frequency is polarized and enters the electromagnet through a hole in the pole pieces. The optical medium is placed in the gap between the pole pieces. The plane of polarization of the laser beam is rotated when the optical medium is subjected to a magnetic field. The angle of Faraday rotation is then measured on the angular scale of the analyzer. 

The procedure for measuring the angles is most easily accomplished by measuring the angle for which the light intensity entering the photometer is at a minimum (angle of extinction) with or without the magnetic field present. The laser beam remains extinct only for a very brief angular interval which allows for taking accurate measurements.

Measurements of the angle of rotation, length of the optical medium and magnetic field intensity, with the help of Equations \ref{equ:feFaradayRotation} and \ref{equ:fedFaradayRotation3}, will in turn facilitate the calculation of the Verdet constant and  the dispersion coefficient for each optical medium.

\section{{\bf Experimental Procedure}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Turn on the photometer and choose a suitable operating range for working under the given background lighting conditions. The indicator should never go off scale.
\item Before turning on the power supply, make certain that there is water running through the cooling coils of the electromagnet (see Figure \ref{fig:feExperimentalSetup}). The electromagnet will get overheated and damaged otherwise. Also note that because of remanent magnetism in the core of the electromagnet, $B$ is not going to be zero for zero current. The current I can be increased to a maximum of about 3.5 A, at a maximum voltage of about 250 V. 
\item For each optical medium measure, $d$, the net length of the sample. Place the sample in the sample holder inside the electromagnet gap and, for zero current through the coils, find the angle at which the polarizer-analyzer pair extinguishes the laser light falling onto the photocell. This is the angle of extinction. The laser beam is plane polarized upon leaving the laser, but it is too intensive to be aimed directly at the photocell. 
\item Record the angle of extinction, then take measurements of  versus I for a full range of coil currents I. Due to time constraints, $B$ is not measured directly in the experiment. Use the calibration equation to convert from I to $B$, where I is measured in Amperes and $B$ is in Tesla. The calibration equation is

\begin{equation}
B = -0.00092942 + 0.12506632 I - 0.00896964 I^{2}
\label{equ:feBConversion}
\end{equation}

\item For samples containing a liquid, it will be necessary to subtract the effect of the container on the readings obtained in the experiment. This is accomplished by taking a separate set of readings using an empty cell, then correcting the original readings. For each optical medium, tabulate the data, plot $\phi$ versus $d \cdot B$ and calculate the value of the Verdet constant $V$.
\item For each optical medium, calculate the value of the dispersion coefficient $\frac{dn}{d\lambda}$. The wavelength of the laser can be found on the laser. 
\item Perform steps 3 through 6 for the Test Material, SFS09 material, SFS06 material, SF8 material and one other material of your choosing.
\end{enumerate}

\section{{\bf Error Analysis}}

Uncertainties in this experiment arise in the measurements of the magnetic field intensity, the effective length of the optical medium and the angle of Faraday rotation. Propagate the uncertainties using any appropriate method.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

	To study the radioactive decay of $^{226}$Ra using an alpha spectrometer and gain experience using radiochemistry techniques in order to purify a $^{226}$Ra sample.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Alpha Particle Detection}
	
	Henry Becquerel (1852-1908) discovered \textbf{radioactivity} in 1896 when he noticed that some uranium compounds caused film to be exposed even in the absence of light. 
	He later determined that the source of the radioactivity was not chemical in nature but in fact the phenomenon originated from the element \textbf{uranium}. 
	In 1902 Marie (1867-1934) and Pierre (1859-1906) Curie found that \textbf{thorium} also exhibited radioactivity. 
	Becquerel and the Curies received the 1903 Nobel prize in physics for these discoveries. 
	The Curies proceeded to carefully study the ores of uranium and thorium to further isolate the actual sources of the radiation. 
	They found two new elements \textbf{polonium}, named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland, and \textbf{radium}, named after radioactivity itself.
	These new elements turned out to be even more radioactive than thorium and uranium. 
	After four years of effort, a tenth of a gram of radium was isolated from several tons of ore. 
	Unfortunately Pierre Curie died in a traffic accident in 1906. 
	Marie Curie took over Pierre's professorship at the Sorbonne and continued to work on the study of radioactivity. 
	In 1911 Marie Curie received a second Nobel prize in chemistry for her work on the isolation of polonium and radium. 
	The units of radiation activity are now called \textbf{Becquerels} (Bq) and \textbf{Curies} (Ci) in honor of their work.

	It is now known that radioactive elements are unstable and emit radiation in the process of transforming themselves into stable elements lower down in the periodic table. 
	Several different kinds of radioactive decays exist, including  \textbf{gamma decay}, \textbf{beta decay}, and \textbf{alpha decay}. 
	Moreover, the same element can decay in different ways and different isotopes of the same element exist which can also decay in different ways. 
	This experiment examines the radioactive decay of one isotope of radium known as $^{226}_{88}$Ra. Radium 226 is known to decay by the emission of an alpha particle into radon 222. 
	The reaction is

\begin{equation}
^{226}_{88}Ra \rightarrow \  ^{222}_{86}Rn + \alpha
\label{equ:RaDecay}%eq1
\end{equation}

If conservation of mass-energy is applied to this reaction, the equation becomes

\begin{equation}
mass(^{226}_{88}Ra)c^2 = \  mass(^{222}_{86}Rn)c^2 + mass(\alpha)c^2 + Q
\label{equ:RaDecayMassEnergy}%eq2
\end{equation}

where $c = 2.99792\times 10^8\ m/s$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $Q$ is the excess mass energy of the process. Decay is only possible if $Q$ is positive. This excess energy appears mostly as the kinetic energy of the  particle. This kinetic energy can be measured and used as a signature for the observed decay.

\newpage
Figure \ref{fig:ndApparatus} shows the experimental arrangement. A sample of purified radium 226 is placed underneath a detector. The detector produces a characteristic electrical pulse for each particle emitted from the radioactive sample that interacts with the detector. The size of this pulse is determined by the kinetic energy of the detected particle. The probability of the emitted particle being detected depends upon the degree of interaction of the particle with the detector material. Alpha particles are easily stopped and absorbed so there is a high probability that they will be intercepted by the detector. On the other hand, gamma rays are quite penetrating, so the probability of interaction with the detector is lower, especially if the detector is thin. Beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles but less penetrating than gamma rays.

	As the sample emits radiation, the \textbf{solid state detector} produces a stream of pulses of varying heights into an instrument called a \textbf{pulse height analyser} or \textbf{PHA}. This instrument tallies all the incoming pulses and sorts them according to their size. The PHA counts the number of pulses that arrive at each energy and graphs the result. The end product on the display is an \textbf{energy spectrum} of the sample. Peaks in the energy spectrum correspond to the characteristic energies at which the sample is emitting alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. Even though particles and rays are emitted from the sample almost mono energetically, the spectrum shows significant spreading around the peaks. %Peaks from decays are inherently wide because of the effect of neutrinos.

%	This spreading of beta and gamma ray peaks happens because the emitted particles are subject to other processes on the way between the emitter and the detector and because the detector electronics and the PHA do not treat each electrical pulse in a perfectly uniform manner. Gamma rays are inherently penetrating, so it is quite likely that a  ray can pass through the detector leaving behind only a fraction of its energy. This fraction varies from event to event, with the end result of a widened peak about some centered value.

%The spreading phenomenon for alpha particles is even more prominent than in beta and gamma particles. 
Alpha particles are easily attenuated such that a sheet of paper is sufficient to completely block them. 
Therefore the thickness of the sample can have a large effect on the energy of the ejected alpha particle. 
Alpha particles emitted from within a sample can lose a portion of their energy before they escape the surface. 
This causes a spreading of the peaks and it is for this reason that only trace amounts of radium are used, minimizing the sample's thickness.
Further peak spreading can also occur from the interaction of the alpha particles with the air between the sample and the detector. 
To minimize this effect the chamber is put under vacuum.

\subsection{Decay Chains}

	Radium decays to another element which is in turn unstable and so decays further. It turns out that this sequence of decays extends through about ten different elements before finally culminating in an element that is stable. The other isotopes in the decay chain of radium are called \textbf{daughter products}. This means that any sample of radium left for any length of time automatically becomes contaminated with several other elements, even if it was pure to begin with. So, in order to study the energy spectrum of radium 226 and nothing else, the sample must be purified. Fortunately, the isolation of radium undertaken in this experiment is considerably easier to perform than the four years of arduous effort the Curies undertook to do it the first time.

	Radioactive decay is a process of \textbf{transmutation}. After a decay, the actual element remaining has changed to a \textbf{different} element. This means that radium can be \textbf{chemically separated} from the element that it decays into and all the other daughter products. Radium is a group 2 metal. So chemically, it acts like barium or calcium. Moreover, all the other natural group 2 metals are stable and no isotope of any other group 2 metal appears in the decay chain of radium. This means that any chemical process that preferentially isolates group 2 metals will succeed in separating radium from all of its daughter isotopes. If such a chemical procedure is performed on a sample that once contained only radium, then the result will be a sample whose only remaining radioactive constituent is pure radium. At least for a short while.

	A spectrum of this sample can be taken to observe the radioactivity of radium 226. The theory of radioactive decay predicts that the radium should decay into another element. If this element in turn is unstable it should also decay. This process continues until an isotope is reached that is stable. Eventually an equilibrium should be reached where the radium 226 decay and all the daughter decays are present.

	In this experiment spectra are first taken with calibrated sources of known energy to establish an accurate energy scale on the display. Next, a pure radium 226 sample is prepared and an initial spectrum is taken immediately after preparation. This should yield the energy or energies for the decay of radium alone. Lastly, the spectrometer is left to continue acquiring the spectrum for at least another 24 hours. This should be sufficient time to record the decays of all the other daughter products of radium. The peaks in these spectra can be compared against tables that contain the currently known and accepted decay modes and energies of each isotope. These tables can also be used to determine the sequence of reactions that radium decay follows all the way down to the final stable daughter isotope.

\textbf{Preparation of the radium 226 sample}
\\
\\
	From a safety point of view, this experiment requires \textbf{special precautions} because the radioactive sample is \textbf{not sealed}. So there is a danger of contamination unless proper procedures are followed. If unsure about anything refer to the \textbf{Radiation Safety in the Undergraduate Physics Labs} document or seek the help of the TA. \textbf{Please observe the following precautions as you follow the chemical procedure described below:} 
        
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*),noitemsep]

       \end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Place 5 mL of the radium salt solution into a 25 mL beaker. While stirring with a rod, add 2 drops (no more!) of Ba(NO$_3$)$_2$ solution and 10 drops of K$_2$SO$_4$ solution. Allow the solution to stand for 5 minutes while stirring gently every 10 seconds or so. The BaSO$_4$ will start precipitating out making the solution slightly cloudy. The BaSO$_4$ crystal lattices are slightly impregnated with radium and its decay products.

\item Add 2 mL of disodium-EDTA and NH$_4$OH solution and stir for 1 minute. The cloudiness of the mixture should disappear. If not, keep stirring for 5 more minutes. If the mixture is still cloudy add another mL of disodium-EDTA. This process isolates radium from its decay products. To recover the BaSO$_4$ precipitate, (which will have radium atoms in some of its vacancies and interstitials) add 2 mL of concentrated acetic acid. Using the indicator paper, confirm a pH level of about 4. If the indicator paper does not show adequate acidity, add more acid, carefully, in small quantities.

\item Wait 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The next step is to pass the solution through a fine filter to keep the solid material while removing the liquids. Note that the filter is \textbf{white} while the non-porous spacer is \textbf{blue}. The filter apparatus is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ndRadium}. While waiting, set up the filter funnel and check that nothing leaks around the sides by pouring in some distilled water. Usually, if there is a leak, it is because the filter paper is not properly centered over the screen. Once it is ready, pour the contents of the beaker into the funnel. After a few minutes, the solution should be dripping through the filter. If the drip rate is too slow, vacuum may slowly be applied. If the solution does not seem to be dripping double check to make sure a spacer wasn't used in place of a filter. After the solution has run through, rinse the inside of the funnel with distilled water and apply vacuum to remove the last traces of liquid.

\item While the sample is dripping through the filter, spread some white glue onto a plastic sample disk. When the sample is ready, very carefully remove the filter and glue it onto the plastic disk. \ul{Do NOT touch the surface}. Use the supplied tweezers as a spatula to move the filter onto the disk from underneath without touching the top. This is the radium 226 source. Allow the sample to dry. Place a table lamp over it to speed up the drying process. The radium sample is now ready to be placed into the spectrometer and measured. Again, when transferring the disk to the sample chamber, do \textbf{not} touch the filter surface and do \textbf{not} let the filter surface touch anything. Rinse the beaker, graduated cylinder, and stirring rod with some distilled water after the sample preparation is completed. The rinse water and the filtered liquid must both be poured into the liquid radioactive waste bottle. Any solid wastes like the pH paper and the gloves should be left in the solid radioactive waste container.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Turn on the spectrometer using the power switch at the back of the unit. Notice that there are two detector chambers referred to as inputs 1 and 2 from left to right, respectively. Turn the computer on and start the Maestro PHA software unless it is already running. Make sure the spectrum window corresponds to the chamber that will be used. If not, the appropriate chamber can be selected via the drop-down menu in the top tool-bar. Turn on the vacuum pump connected to the spectrometer.
%The spectrum area can be cleared by choosing the \textit{Clear} item from the \textit{Acquire} menu. Erase any previous energy calibrations by going to \textit{Calibration} under the \textit{Calculate} menu and clicking on the \textit{Destroy Calibration} button in the resulting pop-up window. Next,  

%Before collecting data, the chamber pressure and detector bias settings must be set. To adjust these settings open the \textit{MCB Properties} window under the \textit{Acquire} menu. The chamber pressure settings are under the \textit{Alpha} tab. Use the drop-down menu to select whether to vent, pump down or maintain the pressure of the chamber. When pumping down the chambers make sure the \textit{Vacuum Monitoring} box is checked. Note that both chambers are connected so they will vent and pump down at the same time, therefore make sure that both chamber doors are closed when pumping down the pressure. The detector bias can be turned on and off under the \textit{High Voltage} tab. Before turning the bias on, make sure that the \textit{Target} box reads 60 Volts. The following precautions need to be observed when using this detector:

%        \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*),noitemsep]
%          {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{\ul{Always set the detector bias to zero before pumping down or venting the chamber(s).}}}
%          {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{\ul{Do not expose a biased detector to light as it overflows the detector amplifier.}}}
%          {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{\ul{Never store a source in the sample chamber(s) except when taking a spectrum.}}}
%        \end{enumerate}
        
\item The following procedure should be used whenever inserting or removing a sample into the sample chamber:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*),noitemsep]
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{{Put the source into the chamber without touching the detector or the sides and close the chamber door.}}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{{The chamber pressure settings are adjusted under the \textbf{Alpha} tab in the \textbf{MCB Properties} window. To pump the chamber down, set the target pressure to \textbf{300 mTorr}, set the vent/pump drop-down menu to pump and check the vacuum monitoring box.}}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{{Wait until the chamber pressure stabilizes around the target pressure.}}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{{To adjust the detector bias voltage, click the \textbf{Acquire} menu and open the \textbf{MCB Properties} window. Under the \textbf{High Voltage} tab, turn the detector bias on making sure the target box reads {\bf 60V}.}}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{{To begin collecting data, click the green "Go" button in the top tool-bar on the far left. Similarly, to stop collecting data click the red "Stop" button.}}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{{After acquiring a spectrum, turn the detector bias off, unclick the vacuum monitoring box and set the vent/pump drop-down menu to vent. }}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{{Wait until the pressure equalizes before opening the chamber door to retrieve source.}}}
  \end{enumerate}
        
\item Do an energy calibration of the spectrometer with the $^{239}$Pu-$^{241}$Am-$^{244}$Cm triple source and the $^{230}$Th source. Always handle alpha sources by grabbing the edges and make sure to never touch the top or bottom. Place this source disk onto the sample holder and slide it into one of the top spots making sure it does not come into contact with anything. Note that the calibration is specific to one shelf, therefore all future sources must be placed on the same shelf. Acquire a spectrum for the triple source and thorium source for about five minutes. Calibrate the spectrum using the three largest peaks of the triple source and the two largest peaks of the $^{230}$Th  source. The triple source energies are 5156.59 keV ($^{239}$Pu), 5544 keV ($^{241}$Am), and 5804.82 keV ($^{244}$Cm) and the two $^{230}$Th  peaks are 4621.2 keV and 4687.7 keV. The calibration procedure is as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*),noitemsep]
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{Erase any previous energy calibrations by going to the \textit{Calculate} menu, selecting \textit{Calibration} and then clicking on the \textit{Destroy Calibration} button in the resulting pop-up window.}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{Acquire the triple source spectrum. The three largest peaks correspond to the three energies stated in the paragraph above. Select a channel close to the apex of the first peak, go to the ROI menu and click on "Mark Peak". The peak will turn red indicating that it is a Region of Interest (ROI). Select a channel within this ROI, go to the \textit{Calculate} menu select \textit{Calibration} and input the corresponding energy of that peak. The program will automatically select the channel of the apex. Do this for the remaining two peaks of the triple source. Once the triple source peaks are calibrated create a ROI Report under the \textit{File} menu, save the spectrum, clear it, clear the ROI's and acquire the $^{230}$Th  spectrum. }}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{Calibrate the two $^{230}$Th  peaks using the same procedure used for the triple source.}}
    {\setlength\itemindent{25pt}\item\textit{Once the $^{230}$Th  peaks are calibrated, create a ROI Report, save the spectrum, clear the ROI's and clear the spectrum. The detector is now calibrated for the analysis of your $^{226}$Ra sample.}}
  \end{enumerate}

\item For all spectra taken with this experiment, remember to save a copy of the spectrum in a computer file for later analysis. As a consistency check of the energy calibration, measure the spectra of the polonium 210 source which emits $\alpha$ particles at an energy of 5304.38 keV.

\item Prepare the $^{226}$Ra sample and obtain an initial spectrum of about ten minutes duration. 

\item Continue gathering data for at least another 24 hours to yield a final spectrum.

\item When measurements are completed dispose of the radium sample into the solid waste container. Do not leave any sources in the sample chamber.

\item Perform any \ul{one} of the following investigations.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.,]
    \item Explain how to use your final radium spectrum to estimate the mass of radium present in the sample. Determine how many picograms of radium are in the sample.
    \item As a rule of thumb, although there are exceptions, the larger the energy of decay the shorter the half-life. For all the alpha sources used in this experiment, plot alpha energy versus half life. Does the graph suggest any correlation between half life and energy? Is the relationship linear (straight line), logarithmic (straight line on a log graph) or does a power law (straight line on a log-log graph) fit the data best?
    \item Explain how to use the final radium spectrum to estimate the activity of the sample. Find the activity of your sample in both Curies and Becquerels.
    \item Treat your peaks as statistical distributions and compute the mean, variance, and skewness of one of them. Compare your directly measured standard deviation to the one inferred from the FWHM. Compare your skewness to the expected skewness of a Gaussian which is zero.
    \item The $^{230}$Th  source has a calibrated activity of 5.89 nCi. Using your $^{230}$Th  spectrum, estimate the actual activity of the source and compare it to the expected value. Discuss possible reasons for any discrepancies.
    \item Some of the isotopes in the decay chain of radium 226 (including radium 226 itself) can decay in more than one way. Using the Firestone isotope tables, trace the decay chain in more detail. Identify some of the rarer decay schemes that have been observed to happen. Some of these decay modes are exotic enough that they are not mentioned in your textbook.
    \item The half life of radium 226 is thousands of years. The half life of all the other daughters is comparatively short, a few days at most. In this situation, the rate of production of the daughters is ultimately limited by the much slower rate of decay of the radium parent. Here, it is expected that the concentration of each daughter should approach a constant value. This phenomenon is called \textbf{secular equilibrium}. The hypothesis of secular equilibrium can be tested by recording the height of a peak versus time to see whether it actually approaches a constant value. For one of the daughter peaks, record at least six peak heights over a period of two or three days. Plot a graph of peak height versus time. Present your conclusions on whether the peak height appears to be approaching a constant value or not.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}


\section{Uncertainty Analysis}
The largest source of uncertainty in energy measurements of $\alpha$ particles is the width of the peaks caused by the attenuation of the $\alpha$ particles before hitting the detector. This results in a peak that is wide and rounded instead of narrow and sharp. A standard method of assigning error to a peak in a radiation spectrum is to use the \textbf{full width half maximum}, or \textbf{FWHM} as seen in Figure \ref{fig:ndGaussian}.

  \caption{Gaussian Distribution}
  \label{fig:ndGaussian}
\end{marginfigure}

	Suppose an energy peak has height H. Then the FWHM of a peak is the width of the peak at half height or H/2. If the peak is Gaussian, then the error in the energy of that peak, $u(E)$, can be taken to be the standard deviation, $\sigma$, of the peak. For a Gaussian distribution this is given by

\begin{equation}
\Delta E = \sigma = \frac{FWHM}{2.35}
\label{equ:ndGaussian}
\end{equation}

	Strictly speaking, the peaks in this experiment are not Gaussian because alpha particle peaks tend to have tails on the low energy side and peaks can also overlap. Nevertheless, the FWHM technique is still a reasonable approximation for the error in the energy of the peak. Often peaks overlap or are superimposed on some other background. For these situations, the procedure is to subtract away the other peaks and the background so that the peak rides on the zero line as seen in Figure \ref{fig:ndGaussian}. This extra procedure is not needed for this experiment because the extra accuracy gained thereby is unimportant here.

	No further error analysis of the data in this experiment is required except for the error in the energy, which should be determined by the FWHM method described here.

\section{Discussion}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item Identify and label all of the peaks measured by the alpha spectrometer. Using a Chart of the Nuclides, the CRC handbook, or the Firestone isotope tables, list the possible decays undergone by the prepared $^{226}$Ra source and its daughter nuclides. It is sufficient to restrict your attention to only the decay of highest probability at each step. Calculate theoretical Q values for the alpha decays and compare these with your measured values. Remember that Q values are different from the kinetic energy of the alpha particle because of recoil of the nucleus. Label the final $^{226}$Ra spectrum based on your identification of the isotopes undergoing alpha decay. For each daughter product, determine whether the element is a solid, liquid, or gas at room temperature.
  \item Discuss any \ul{two} of the following items.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
      \item Why is it necessary to evacuate the chamber in which the source is positioned for measurement? Why is it more practical to place a radioactive sample underneath a detector facing up, rather than above a detector and facing down?
      \item The PHA records the energy of the alpha particle along the x-axis. What is recorded along the y-axis? What factors affect the height of a peak measured by the spectrometer?
      \item Other decays besides alpha decay are occurring as the $^{226}$Ra and daughter nuclides decay. Explain why the occurrences of these decays are not recorded by the PHA.
      \item Radium has a long half life on the order of thousands of years. All the unstable daughter products of radium have much shorter half lives on the order of days or hours. This implies that the rate of production of each of the daughters is limited to the rate at which radium decays. In practice, after a week or two, the concentration of all the daughters should be the same. However, what happens in this apparatus is that the first peak (the decay of radium into radon) ends up being more than twice as large as all the other peaks and the remaining peaks are the same height. Why does this happen?
      \item Judging from the initial spectrum, discuss how well the chemical separation of the radium from its daughters worked.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Discuss the results of the optional part of the experiment.

\section{Preparation}

	You should review Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect. Review the band theory of conduction in metals, and the diffraction of light.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

	To investigate some properties of the photoelectric effect and photocells. To get some experience with low level current measurements. To better understand optical spectra by using a monochromator and a Tungsten-Halogen lamp as a line source.

\section{Theory}

	The \textbf{photoelectric effect} is one example of an interaction between energy and matter. In the photoelectric effect, a material is illuminated with a beam of light and electrons are ejected from the material. These emitted electrons are called \textbf{photoelectrons}. This effect occurs in any material, whether solid, liquid, or gas. The photoelectric effect was first noticed by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894) in 1887 when he observed that shining ultraviolet light into the region between a spark gap raised the conductivity of the air in the gap. Later experiments showed that shining ultraviolet light onto a metallic plate gave it a positive charge. In 1898 Philipp Lenard (1862-1947) and J. J. Thompson (1856-1940) showed that the particles being emitted were actually electrons. Lenard later won the 1905 Nobel prize in physics for his work on electrons. Thompson won the 1906 Nobel prize for his related work on the conduction of gases. As described below, the photoelectric effect has many properties that simply cannot be accounted for by a wave theory of light. In 1900, to partly explain the effect, Max Planck (1858-1947) suggested that an atom could only absorb or emit energy in discrete bundles called \textbf{quanta}. He was later honoured with the 1918 Nobel prize for this insight. It was left to Albert Einstein (1879-1955) in 1905 to fully explain the photoelectric effect using Planck's ideas. Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect explains all the observed properties of the photoelectric effect. He won the 1921 Nobel prize for this work. Einstein's theory of photoelectricity was experimentally verified by Robert Millikan (1868-1953) in 1916 in a series of careful measurements that also accurately determined Planck's constant for the first time. This work earned Millikan a Nobel prize in 1923. The physics experiment to be done here is in fact similar in method and construction to Millikan's prize winning experiment.

	If one assumes that the photoelectric interaction is simply a light wave phenomenon then several conclusions follow immediately. The wave theory predicts that the energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the square of the light frequency. Also, there should be photoelectrons at any wavelength, if the light is intense enough. Third, the electron energy should be proportional to the light intensity. Fourth, the electrons should be emitted with a large delay that depends on the light intensity and the illumination area. Lastly, the amount of electrons knocked off should be proportional to the size of the atom and hence to the amount of surface exposed to the light.

	Experimental measurements of the photoelectric effect show that \textbf{none} of these properties are true. The energy of the photoelectrons varies \textbf{linearly} with frequency. Below a critical frequency, \textbf{no} photoelectrons are emitted regardless of the light intensity. Furthermore, the photelectron energy is \textbf{independent} of the light intensity and the illumination area. Lastly, there is essentially \textbf{no delay} between the arrival of light and the emission of photoelectrons, regardless of the light intensity and illumination area.

	Einstein explained the photoelectric effect by supposing that the energy of electromagnetic radiation is carried in discrete bundles called \textbf{photons}.  The energy, $E$, of a photon is given by

\begin{equation}
E = hf
\label{equ:pePhotonEnergy}
\end{equation}

where $f$ is the frequency of the light and $h$ is Planck's constant. The currently accepted value for Planck's constant is $6.6261\times10^{-34}$ $J\cdot s$. Equation \ref{equ:pePhotonEnergy} implies that higher frequency light like ultraviolet radiation is more energetic than lower frequency light such as infrared light. Each photon can only give up a discrete amount of energy, $E$, to an electron. Suppose that the electron is bound to the material with energy $W$. This is then the amount of energy needed to liberate an electron from the surface of a material. $W$ is called the \textbf{work function} of the material. Any extra energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the photoelectron.

	The energy balance equation for the incoming photon versus the outgoing photoelectron is

\begin{equation}
hf = W + K
\label{equ:peEnergyBalance}
\end{equation}

where $K$ is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. Therefore, a photoelectron has kinetic energy given by

\begin{equation}
K = hf - W
\label{equ:pePhotoelectronKineticEnergy}
\end{equation}

	This equation handily explains all the observed features of the photoelectric effect. There is a lower limit below which the light generates no photoelectrons because a photon with energy less than $W$ does not have enough energy to liberate an electron from the surface of the material. If the photon does have sufficient energy (high enough frequency), an electron is knocked loose as soon as a photon interacts with it. This explains why the emission of photoelectrons is nearly simultaneous with the arrival of the illuminating light. Also, Equation \ref{equ:pePhotoelectronKineticEnergy} shows directly why the energy of a photoelectron varies linearly with the illuminating light frequency. Lastly, Equation \ref{equ:pePhotoelectronKineticEnergy} shows that the energy of a photoelectron is independent of light intensity. When a bright light illuminates a surface, many more electrons are knocked out of the surface because there are more photons, but each photoelectron has the kinetic energy specified by Equation \ref{equ:pePhotoelectronKineticEnergy}. Brighter illumination induces a higher \textbf{photocurrent}, simply because more photoelectrons are in motion.

	The arrangement used for examining the photoelectric effect is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pePhotocell}. Light is made to shine on a potassium surface called the \textbf{photocathode}. Photoelectrons are ejected from this surface and collected by the nearby platinum ring called the \textbf{anode}. The work function of potassium is 2.30 eV and the work function of platinum is 5.65 eV. This means light with a wavelength longer than about 540 nm will not eject electrons from either the platinum or the potassium. Light with a wavelength shorter than 220 nm will begin to eject photoelectrons from the anode as well as the photocathode. This gives a window from 540 nm to 220 nm in which photoelectrons are ejected from the photocathode alone. This is the wavelength range for which Equation \ref{equ:pePhotoelectronKineticEnergy} can be examined. The anode and photocathode are in vacuum so the  photoelectrons do not lose energy except at the anode.

        \end{figure}
	 The emission of electrons from the photocathode (photocurrent) is detected by the electrometer. An \textbf{electrometer} is basically an extremely sensitive current meter. The anode voltage polarity opposes the arrival of photoelectrons. The energy of the photoelectrons is found by raising the anode voltage to the point where the photocurrent stops. If the illuminating light is monochromatic, this \textbf{stopping potential} , $V_s$, gives a determination for the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons so that

\begin{equation}
V_s = \frac{h}{e}f - \frac{W}{e}
\label{equ:peStoppingPotential}
\end{equation}

	Since $e = 1.6022\times10^{-19}$ C, plotting stopping voltage versus illumination frequency gives a value for Planck's constant from the slope of the line. The arrangement of Figure 1 also permits experimental verification that stopping voltage (kinetic energy) is independent of light intensity but the photocurrent (as measured by the electrometer) is strongly dependent on the light intensity. It is also possible to verify that below a certain critical frequency, no photocurrent is stimulated regardless of light level.

	Equation \ref{equ:pePhotoelectronKineticEnergy} suggests that the intercept of the graph yields the work function of the potassium photocathode, $Wc$. A more careful examination indicates that this is incorrect. Both the cathode and the anode are made from metals. This means the outer shell electrons inside the metal partially fill an energy band called the \textbf{conduction band}. The highest energy level in the conduction band with an electron in it is called the \textbf{Fermi energy}. At absolute zero there are no electrons above the Fermi energy and all energy levels below the Fermi energy are completely filled with electrons. At higher temperatures this boundary is not sharp as many electrons move to higher levels on thermal energy alone. The fact the the Fermi energy lies in the middle of the conduction band explains why the metal is a good conductor. There are many nearby unfilled energy levels available for the electrons to occupy.

	To fully remove an electron, a surface needs more energy than just the Fermi energy. The aggregate attraction of the complete metallic lattice prevents the electron from being free even when removed from the conduction band. The extra required energy to completely free an electron from the surface is called the \textbf{surface barrier energy}. The surface barrier energy depends greatly on the exact nature of the surface. Impurities, trace gases, and crystal structure all affect the surface barrier energy and hence the perceived work function of the material. The work function for a metal is the sum of the Fermi energy and the surface barrier energy. Figure \ref{fig:peEnergyLevels} shows an energy level diagram for the conduction electrons in the metallic cathode and anode. The retarding voltage applied to the anode determines the potential difference between the Fermi levels in the anode and photocathode. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:peEnergyLevels}, this is \textbf{not} the retarding potential seen by a photoelectron travelling between cathode and anode.

  \label{fig:peEnergyLevels}
\end{marginfigure}

	To find the true retarding potential as seen by a photoelectron, let $V_s'$ be the true stopping potential and $V_s$ be the potential as seen by the voltmeter. Then from Figure \ref{fig:peEnergyLevels}

\begin{equation}
V_s ' = V_s + \frac{W_a}{e} - \frac{W_c}{e}
\label{equ:peTrueStoppingPotential}
\end{equation}

and Equation \ref{equ:peStoppingPotential} is really

\begin{equation}
V_s ' = \frac{h}{e}f - \frac{W_c}{e}
\label{equ:peTrueStoppingPotentialCathode}
\end{equation}

As seen by the voltmeter this is

\begin{equation}
V_s  =  \frac{h}{e}f - \frac{W_a}{e}
\label{equ:peStoppingPotentialAnode}
\end{equation}

	The above discussion suggests that the measured intercept should be regarded with some suspicion. However, the slope determination is not affected. It also suggests that the transition of the photocurrent to zero as the stopping potential is increased will be gradual rather than abrupt because the photoelectrons arise from a population of conduction electrons with widely varying energies. Some electrons will manage to cross from cathode to anode on thermal energy alone. This is \textbf{thermionic emission}. Since this current flows even without light, it is also called \textbf{dark current}. At room temperature the dark current is very small. 

	Another obscuring phenomenon is that over time the anode ring becomes contaminated with cathode material. Now the anode will also emit photoelectrons when illuminated. This is rectified by heating the anode until it begins to glow light red. Both ends of the anode are connected to an Anatek power supply capable of delivering 2 Amperes. Note that under normal operation one side of the anode is left unconnected. The procedure should be done in a darkened room while carefully observing the anode. The entire process does not last longer than 15 seconds. This procedure can only be carried out by qualified lab staff.

  \caption{Light path of the monochromator}
  \label{fig:peLightPath}
\end{figure}


	The photocell must be illuminated with monochromatic light for meaningful results. The method chosen for generating such light in this experiment is called a \textbf{monochromator}. It has the advantage that a large number of frequencies can be easily generated. This permits a careful examination of Equation \ref{equ:peStoppingPotentialAnode}. The light path of the monochromator is shown in Figure \ref{fig:peLightPath}. In effect, it is a reflection grating spectrometer that is connected backwards. It generates monochromatic light from a source instead of analyzing one frequency of light from a source as a spectrometer would. The source used is an ordinary Tungsten-Halogen lamp. This lamp generates light from the far infrared into the ultraviolet. To select a given wavelength, a knob rotates the grating. Special gears couple this rotation to a display that reads out the wavelength chosen in nanometers. The output from the monochromator is not truly monochromatic. The output spectral width is roughly 1 nanometer.

	The photocurrents to be measured in this experiment are on the order of picoamperes ($10^{-12}$ Amperes). At these low current levels, special precautions must be taken to obtain valid measurements. Materials that are normally considered to be insulators become conductors instead. The reason is because a source of picoampere current at one volt potential has an effective resistance of $10^{12}\ \Omega$. This resistance is comparable to the resistance of many common insulators such as paper, rubber, and plastic. Instead of insulating the circuit, these materials act like ordinary resistors and become part of the circuit. 

	To help with low current measurements, the wiring should be as short a possible. This minimizes the amount of insulator present and reduces the area available for noise pickup. The electrometer is designed with this in mind. The sensing preamplifier head is separate from the rest of the instrument. In this way the sensing head can be placed very close to the source to be measured using short cables. The photocell cathode is directly connected to the electrometer sensor head with a short 20 cm cable.

	Materials under mechanical motion or stress exhibit charge imbalances that manifest themselves as currents. These are called \textbf{piezoelectric effects}. Frictional effects such as when two materials rub against each other also produce charge displacements. These are called \textbf{triboelectric effects}. To eliminate these sources of error, motion, vibration, and mechanical stress must be prevented in all components, connections, and wiring. 

	Very high resistance materials like sapphire, quartz, and Teflon should be used where possible. These have volumetric resistances on the order of $10^{17}\ \Omega$. The electrometer head is insulated with sapphire. However, \textbf{cleanliness} is important. Contaminants such as dust, moisture, grease, fingerprints, and salt provide paths for \textbf{surface leakage currents}. Do \textbf{not touch} circuit components or wires by hand. Use a tissue or rubber gloves instead.

	Lastly, reduce stray electrical fields by reducing air currents and the motion of nearby people. Articles that generate strong static electric fields like sweaters, furs, coats, or long hair should be removed from the low current measurement area.


\section{Experimental Procedure}

{\bf Note: The room lights must remain off for the duration of this experiment.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first step is to initialize and check the electrometer. No adjustments are needed on the remote preamplifier near the photocell. Short the input by engaging the input shorting switch (this is the up position). This switch is useful for momentarily turning off the meter input when experimental adjustments need to be made. Turn on the unit by setting the function switch to the + current setting. Allow a warm up time of 10 minutes. The electrometer measures currents by reading the voltage across one of three large resistors whose values are specified on the instrument cover. Under normal experimental conditions only R2 is required, except for measuring 10 nA where R1 is needed. Set the input resistor switch to R2. The meter movement and the range switch determine the voltage measured across R2. The current is then found simply from Ohm's law. Turn the range switch to the 1 V range. After the instrument has warmed up, adjust the zero controls until the meter reads zero on the 1 mV range with the input shorted. Put the range switch back to 1 V to reduce the chance of an overflow. Using a tissue (not hands) disconnect the photocell cable from the input and connect the 10 nA current source instead. Measure the current output from each of the three current sources using the electrometer. The current is measured by turning off the shorting switch and reducing the range switch until the meter registers the largest voltage possible without going out of range. If the three current readings are within the correct orders of magnitude as specified on the current source then the electrometer is operating properly. Reconnect the photocell cable (remember, no fingerprints). Always leave the input shorting switch engaged except when taking a measurement.

\item Turn on and check the adjustable stopping potential. Turn on the multimeter and the power supply. Set the power supply to 10.0 V. This voltage remains unchanged for the rest of the experiment. Check that the meter reads the output of the decade divider correctly and that each knob alters the reading by 1 V, 0.1 V, and 0.01 V. Set all knobs on the divider to zero.

\item The monochromator is aligned and adjusted correctly. No adjustments are necessary. Do not bump, jar, or move the monochromator. However a performance test is always appropriate. Power up the laser and shine it into the entrance slit. The laser wavelength is 632.8 nm. Rotate the grating until the laser light is visible at the exit slit. Take note of the monochromator reading of the laser line. This serves as a monochromator offset calibration which should be used for all later measurements. Remove the laser and slide the Tungsten-Halogen lamp forward until it touches the monochromator input slit. Turn on the lamp. The variac voltage for the lamp must be set at 110 V, any higher and the lamp will burn out. With the room lights off, check that the colours visible from the exit slit are consistent with the monochromator wavelength reading. The experiment is now ready for operation.

\item %With the room lights off and the photocell still covered, d
Determine the current being emitted by the photocell. It may be negative, in which case the -current setting is required. This gives a baseline zero reading for the darkened photocell. You may want to think about what this current might be if there is one.

\item These measurements will have to be made in darkness. A small flashlight is used to read and operate the electrometer, divider, multimeter, and monochromator. Keep the flashlight beam away from the photocell. 
%Rotate the photocell cover so that it is open. 
For as many wavelengths as you feel are necessary (at least 12), take measurements of the stopping potential of light with wavelengths ranging from 420 nm to 600 nm. Use a consistent criterion to detect when the photocurrent has stopped. The best method is to simply adjust the divider until the needle reads zero, without changing the range setting of the electrometer. The Fluke multimeter reads out the potential $V_s$. The monochromator dial indicates the wavelength in nm. Notice that the current jumps wildly when people move near the photocell or when the divider is adjusted. The method to use is to make a divider adjustment and then move away and stay still until the electrometer stabilizes. Make further adjustments to the decade divider as required until a zero current reading is obtained. 

\item Perform one of the optional investigations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}
	As discussed in the theory section, there are many variables that affect the outcome of this experiment which are not under the control of the experimenter. No error analysis for these effects is required. Once the monochromator offset is found using the laser, the maximum wavelength error over the 400 nm to 600 nm range will be $\pm$1.0 nm. Estimate a reasonable error for the stopping potential. This will not be an instrument error. Rather, it will reflect the uncertainty of finding the actual zero current point that represents the stopping potential. For current measurements, the uncertainty is propagated from the voltage uncertainty (half the smallest division on the meter) and the resistor uncertainty. The resistor uncertainty can be estimated from the number of significant figures that specify the resistor values on the cover of the electrometer. For example, two significant figures implies an error on the order of $\pm$5 in the next smaller digit position. The wavelength error and stopping potential error will propagate to an error in the slope from which Planck's constant is found.

\section{Prelab}
\begin{enumerate}
\item List and briefly discuss three significant considerations when measuring very small currents.
\item Describe what is meant by photocell dark current.
\item The resistors R1, R2, and R3 together with the voltage range switch determine the currents the electrometer can measure. The range switch extends from a 30 V scale down to a 1 mV scale. The electrometer resistor values are $R1=0.93\times10^8\ \Omega$, $R2=0.92\times10^{10}\ \Omega$, and $R3=0.90\times10^{12}\ \Omega$. What is the largest and smallest current range on the electrometer? Write your answer once with scientific notation and once with proper SI prefixes.
\end{enumerate}
%%% end prelab %%%

\section{Data Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Record your observations of the current measured by the electrometer when you bend, twist, and/or vibrate the wire connecting the photocell to the input of the electrometer. Note, do NOT exert large forces or displacements on the wire when making these observations, it is not necessary and damages the apparatus.
\item A table of values with uncertainties for the three reference current sources as well as the dark photocell current reading.
\item A value for the wavelength of laser light as measured using the monochromator. A table of the colors observed versus their wavelength from the Tungsten-Halogen lamp.
\item Table of values for the stopping potentials, wavelengths, frequencies and their uncertainties. Include the measured current with a stopping potential of zero (dark current).
\item A graph of stopping potential versus frequency with error bars, and a determination of the slope and intercept (with uncertainties).
\item Any \underline{one} of the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Glass can reflect ultraviolet radiation but not transmit it. Quartz can transmit and reflect ultraviolet light. The Tungsten-Halogen bulb is made from quartz. The photocell and the monochromator are made from glass. Take readings on stopping potentials from 420 nm to 260 nm. Report and explain your observations. What is the minimum change needed to make this experiment work in the ultraviolet light range?
    \item Design and implement an experiment to check whether the stopping potential really is independent of light intensity but the photocurrent really is not. Report your observations and conclusions.
    \item Design and implement an experiment to measure the intensity of the Tungsten-Halogen lamp at different wavelengths. Present your observations and conclusions.
    \item For one given wavelength, plot photocurrent versus stopping potential. Include a table of values with your graph. Discuss whether your data supports the assertion that raising the stopping potential retards the photocurrent.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Based on your graph in $\#$8 above, discuss what the slope represents. From your data, determine an experimental value for Planck's constant and compare this to the accepted value. Briefly discuss in your own words why the value you calculated for the intercept is likely not an accurate measurement of the work function for the photocathode material.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

	To investigate Rutherford scattering using both theory and measurement. To gain experience with pulse height analyzers and nuclear pulse counting techniques. To become familiar with a historical experiment that contributed to the development of modern atomic theory.


\section{Theory}
	A beam of alpha particles emitted from some source is directed at a foil target. Measurements have found that a surprisingly large number of the alpha particles experience deflection through large angles. This important discovery led to the adoption of the Rutherford model of the nuclear atom in place of the Thomson model. It is a classic example of progress in physics arising from the interplay between experimental physics and theoretical physics.

	It is possible to develop a mathematical model of \textbf{Rutherford scattering} if a number of assumptions are made. We assume that

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*),noitemsep]
{\setlength\itemindent{14pt}\item The force causing the deflection of the alpha particles is Coulomb repulsion.}
{\setlength\itemindent{14pt}\item The force center and the alpha particle may be treated as points.}
{\setlength\itemindent{14pt}\item Electrons surrounding the nucleus do not affect the alpha particle trajectory.}
{\setlength\itemindent{14pt}\item The force center does not recoil, it is stationary.}
{\setlength\itemindent{14pt}\item Newton's Laws apply, relativity and quantum mechanics can be neglected.}
\end{enumerate}

	In this model, the positively charged alpha particle approaches a positively charged nucleus and changes direction because of electrostatic repulsion. Using the above assumptions it is possible to show that the trajectory of the alpha particle is a hyperbola given by (Fig. \ref{fig:rsTrajectory})

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{b} \sin\phi + \frac{(ze)\cdot(Ze)}{8\pi\epsilon_0Kb^2}(\cos\phi - 1)
\label{equ:rsTrajectory}%eq1
\end{equation}

	This hyperbola is expressed in polar coordinates (r,$\phi$). The variable b is called the \textbf{impact parameter} and represents the minimum possible distance of the alpha particle from the nucleus if neither were charged. An impact parameter of zero is a direct collision. The alpha particle has electronic charge ze while the nucleus has charge Ze. Therefore the kinetic energy of the alpha particle, K, must be expressed in electron-volts for the dimensions of Equation \ref{equ:rsTrajectory} to balance.

	If we now consider the final position of the particle by setting r = $\infty$ and  $\phi$ = $\pi$ - $\theta$  then Equation \ref{equ:rsTrajectory} takes the form
	
\begin{equation}
b = \frac{(ze)\cdot(Ze)}{8\pi\epsilon_0K} \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\label{equ:rsTrajectoryBounded}%eq2
\end{equation}

	It is not currently possible to monitor the collision between one $\alpha$-particle and one nucleus. A probabilistic approach for handling multiple particles and nuclei is therefore required in order to proceed further.

	Suppose it were possible to make a sheet of material just one atom thick. Then the total area of the sheet, $A_f$, could be approximated by

\begin{equation}
A_f = N\pi R^2
\label{equ:rsSheetArea}%eq3
\end{equation}

where N is the number of atoms in the sheet and R is the radius of a single atom. To an incoming particle each atom would appear as a disk.

  \caption{Trajectory on Foil Surface}
  \label{fig:rsTrajectory2}
\end{marginfigure}

	From Figures \ref{fig:rsTrajectory} and \ref{fig:rsTrajectory2} it can be seen that smaller impact parameters produce greater deflections while larger impact parameters generate lesser deflections. If, for a particular impact parameter $b_0$, the deflection is $\theta_0$, then for scattering angles greater than $\theta_0$ the impact parameters must lie in the range from zero to $b_0$. So all projectiles scattered at angles greater than $\theta_0$ will have approached some atom within a disk of area $\pi b^2$. If the incoming $\alpha$-particles are uniformly distributed over the surface of the foil then the \textbf{fraction} of them that scatter into angles greater than $\theta_0$ must be

\begin{equation}
f_{b<b_0} = f_{\theta>\theta_0}=\frac{\pi b^2}{\pi R^2} =\frac{N}{A_f}\cdot\pi b^2
\label{equ:rsFractionScattered}%eq4
\end{equation}

	A real scattering foil must be many atoms thick. Let the foil have area $A_f$ , thickness t, density $\rho$, and molecular weight M. Then the volume of the foil is $A_ft$, the mass of the foil is $\rho A_ft$, and the number of moles of atoms in the foil must then be $\rho A_ft/M$. The number of atoms in the foil is therefore given by

\begin{equation}
N = \frac{\rho A_f t}{M}N_A
\label{equ:rsFoilAtomNumber}%eq5
\end{equation}

where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. Substituting Equation \ref{equ:rsFoilAtomNumber} into Equation \ref{equ:rsFractionScattered} yields the fraction of scattered particles in a \textbf{thick} foil

\begin{equation}
f_{b<b_0} = f_{\theta<\theta_0}=\frac{\rho N_A}{M} \pi b^2t
\label{equ:rsFractionScatteredThickFoil}%eq6
\end{equation}

	Equations \ref{equ:rsTrajectoryBounded} and \ref{equ:rsFractionScatteredThickFoil} together describe how alpha particles scatter when they pass through a foil. To experimentally verify this model all particles scattered above some angle $\theta_0$ must be measured by some detector. It is impractical to build detectors that cover a large portion of a sphere surrounding the foil. What is really needed is an equation that describes the \textbf{probability} for a particle to be scattered into a detector with area $A_d$ at some distance r from the foil.

	Using probability theory, it can be shown that the \textbf{derivative} of a cumulative fraction gives the probability distribution. Differentiating Equation \ref{equ:rsFractionScatteredThickFoil} yields

\begin{equation}
df = 2\frac{\rho N_A}{M} \pi bt db
\label{equ:rsFractionScatteredThickFoilDerivative}%eq7
\end{equation}

The differential of b, db, is found by differentiating Equation \ref{equ:rsTrajectoryBounded}. Then the probability of a projectile at angle $\theta$ being scattered into d$\theta$ is found to be 

\begin{equation}
|df| = \pi\frac{\rho t N_A}{M}\left(\frac{(ze)(Ze)}{2K}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^2\csc^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)d\theta
\label{equ:rsScatteringProbability}%eq8
\end{equation}

  \caption{Scattering ring}
  \label{fig:rsRing}
\end{figure}


	As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:rsRing}, these scattered alpha particles will be uniformly distributed around a ring of radius $r\sin\theta$ and thickness $rd\theta$. The area of the ring, $dA_r$ , is therefore given by

\begin{equation}
dA_r = 2\pi r\sin\theta\cdot rd\theta
\label{equ:rsRingArea}%eq9
\end{equation}

The probability, $N(\theta)$, for scattering into a ring at angle $\theta$ per unit area is thus given by

\begin{equation}
N(\theta) = \frac{|df|}{dA_r}
\label{equ:rsScatteringProbabilityPerArea}%eq10
\end{equation}

Following the example of Equation \ref{equ:rsScatteringProbabilityPerArea} we divide Equation \ref{equ:rsScatteringProbability} by Equation \ref{equ:rsRingArea} to give \textbf{Rutherford's scattering formula}

\begin{equation}
N(\theta) = \frac{\rho tN_A}{Mr^2} \left[ \frac{(ze)(Ze)}{4K} \right]^2 \left( \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \right)^2 \sin^{-4}\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\label{equ:rsRutherfordFormula}%eq11
\end{equation}

If both sides of Equation \ref{equ:rsScatteringProbabilityPerArea} are multiplied by the area of the detector, $A_d$, 

\begin{equation}
A_dN(\theta) = \frac{\rho tN_AA_d}{Mr^2} \left[ \frac{(ze)(Ze)}{4K} \right]^2 \left( \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \right)^2 \sin^{-4}\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\label{equ:rsRutherfordFormulaArea}%eq12
\end{equation}
we obtain the probability that a scattered alpha particle will be incident on that detector at angle $\theta$. 	

Lastly, we wish to convert Equation \ref{equ:rsRutherfordFormulaArea} into a form that is independent of  the foil geometry and the detector geometry. To make Equation \ref{equ:rsRutherfordFormulaArea} independent of foil geometry we divide by the number of atoms per unit area of the foil which is $N/A_f$ (Equation \ref{equ:rsFoilAtomNumber}). To remove the detector geometry dependence we divide by the solid angle subtended by the detector, $\Delta\Omega$ , which is

\begin{equation}
\Delta\Omega=\frac{A_d}{r^2}
\label{equ:rsSolidAngle}%eq13
\end{equation}

This gives the \textbf{theoretical differential scattering cross-section}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\Delta\Omega}=\left[ \frac{(ze)(Ze)}{4K} \right]^2 \left(\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^2\sin^{-4}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\label{equ:rsCrossSectionTheory}%eq14
\end{equation}

The objective of this experiment is to measure the differential scattering cross-section of alpha particles through gold. To experimentally verify Equation \ref{equ:rsCrossSectionTheory} we require measured values that correspond to cross-sections. Equation \ref{equ:rsRutherfordFormulaArea} gives the probability that a scattered $\alpha$-particle will be incident on a detector at angle $\theta$. As an empirical estimate of this we use the ratio of counts detected versus the number of $\alpha$-particles incident on the gold in some time interval $\delta t$. Let the \textbf{incident count rate} of $\alpha$-particles on the target be $R_0$ and the \textbf{detected count rate} of scattered particles at angle $\theta$ be $R_{\theta}$. Then this ratio is

\begin{equation}
\frac{R_{\theta}}{R_{0}}=A_dN(\theta)
\label{equ:rsRatio}%eq15
\end{equation}

Again, we remove the detector geometry dependence and scattering target geometry dependence by dividing out the detector solid angle and the number of atoms per unit area. In this way we obtain the \textbf{measured differential scattering cross-section}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\Delta\Omega} = \frac{Mr^2}{A_dN_A\rho t} \frac{R_{\theta}}{R_{0}}
\label{equ:rsCrossSectionExp}%eq16
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:rsApparatus} depicts the experimental layout. A beam of $\alpha$-particles emitted from an Am$^{241}$ source is directed at a piece of gold leaf foil. The gold foil target is mounted on a wheel that can be rotated to expose other samples if desired. A solid state detector is placed to observe the scattered particles. This detector can be rotated to different angles and the angle measured using the supplied vernier scale. The output of the detector is sent to a pulse height analyzer (PHA) to obtain a \textbf{pulse height spectrum}.  This spectrum is used to determine the count rate of the detected particles. Since the range of alpha particles emitted from the Am$^{241}$ source is less than 4 cm. in air, the entire arrangement is enclosed inside in a vacuum. A lever is provided underneath the vacuum chamber to rotate the detector to different angles. A horseshoe magnet rotates the target wheel from outside the vacuum chamber. Under normal operation no other controls are needed. The detector is sensitive to light so a dark cover must be used.

\section{Experimental Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do a performance check of the vacuum system. The vacuum pump should be running. Turn on the Edwards digital pressure gauge (power switch is at the back of the unit) and press the down arrow on the front panel once to select the proper transducer. Under normal conditions the pressure inside the bell jar should read less than 6.0$\times10^{-2}$ mbar. If there is a problem with the vacuum ask your instructor to contact the lab technician. 

%, do \textbf{not} proceed to step 2. Make sure to turn off the pressure gauge after the reading is taken because it interferes with the operation of the solid state particle detector.
%
%	This paragraph is provided for reference purposes only. None of these procedures should be tried unless a member of the laboratory staff is present. The pump is connected to a large valve which can be used to isolate the chamber from the pump. This valve is seldom used except during pump maintenance and bringing the system up to room pressure. To bring the system back up to room pressure, close the isolation valve and open the other valve located underneath the bell jar. The target foils are very thin, so let air into the system \textbf{slowly} so that they do not tear. Lastly, slowly open the isolation valve. When the chamber is about to be evacuated, check that the rim and grove where the bell jar sits are free of dust and debris. Pump down for at least four hours before powering up the detector. 

\item Do a performance check of the particle detector, spectrometer, pulse height analyzer, computer, and printer. With the vacuum operating correctly and the dark cover in place, turn on the spectrometer. Using the lever underneath the vacuum chamber, rotate the detector in front of the calibration source. Set the energy range to 4-8 MeV and the bias to 50 V. Using the computer and pulse height analyzer, obtain a spectrum for 10 minutes. If the system is working correctly, three well separated peaks should be visible. The three peaks are curium$^{244}$ (5.81 MeV), americium$^{241}$ (5.49 MeV), and plutonium$^{239}$ (5.16 MeV). Calibrate the energy scale on the PHA with these three peaks. Using the PHA computer program, annotate each peak and then print out the spectrum. The solid state particle detector is quite sensitive to abuse. \textbf{Never} turn on the bias voltage unless the dark cover is in place and the chamber is evacuated. \textbf{Never} touch the surface of the detector. \textbf{Never} leave the detector stowed against the calibration source or within the alpha particle beam.

\item  This portion is optional, ask your instructor if you need to perform it. Characterize the incoming alpha particle beam to determine the center angle and the width of the beam. Rotate the sample wheel to a position where there is no target foil using the supplied horseshoe magnet. Make sure the sample wheel is latched in place and pulled as far back towards the particle source as possible. \textbf{Never} put the horseshoe magnet near \textbf{anything} except the sample wheel rotator and the metal shelf where the magnet is stored. Measure count rates at 1 or less degree increments in a 6 degree swath around either side of the estimated center. Determine the probable center angle and the width of the beam. The center angle you measure will define the scattering zero angle.

\item Obtain scattering data with gold foil in place. Rotate the sample wheel to a gold target that has no tears or openings in it. Choose angles starting from just past the forward beam (about 5 degrees from the center angle) to angles further away. For angles greater than 20 degrees long counting times will be required. At each angle obtain a spectrum. Determine the total number of counts. The counts are selected using the \textbf{full-width-half-maximum (FWHM)} method. Choose all counts around the center of the peak out to where the count in a channel is half the count in the maximum channel. Note down the \textbf{live time} taken to acquire the spectrum. Divide FWHM counts by the live time to get a count rate for that angle. Remember to turn off the bias before removing the dark cover to set the detector at a new angle. Also remember to turn it back on after the dark cover is replaced.

\chapter{Laboratory Safety}

\section{Introduction}
People who survive to reach adulthood generally acquire a mental list of safety rules that are followed to prevent injury to themselves and others. These rules are learned 
from sources such as parents, teachers, and experience. However, the practice of experimental physics can involve the handling of materials, instruments, and processes that
lie outside the realm of common experience. The rules described here must be added to your mental list to handle these new situations. This is part of your education in 
physics. For the safety of yourself and others you are required to read, understand, and follow these guidelines.

All of the physics experiments you will perform have been designed with the safety of the student in mind. This necessarily assumes that all the apparatus is used in a 
reasonable manner. Do not mishandle or abuse the equipment. Use your common sense. Always maintain an awareness of the consequences of your actions for yourself and others.
No food, drink, or smoking is permitted in the laboratory, to reduce the chance that it will be contaminated before being consumed. Also, spilled drinks can be dangerous 
near electrical equipment. Some physics experiments use ice or ice water for cooling. Do not eat or drink the ice or ice water, since it may be contaminated. Never work in a
laboratory alone, there should always be someone else present to get help if necessary. In the event of any accident in the lab, you must notify your instructor immediately.
The following comments describe the hazards you may encounter while in a physics laboratory and the relevant safety procedures to follow.

\section{Heavy Metals}
Lead is used for shielding in radiation experiments. Heavy metals such as lead can be absorbed into your body through the skin and mouth. They accumulate in the brain and 
eventually cause brain damage when a large enough amount is present. The total dosage of lead in the brain builds up over your lifetime as a function of total  accumulated 
exposure. Minimize your exposure to lead in the laboratory by handling it as little as possible. Do not touch any food or your face while working with lead. Wash your hands
after handling lead objects. Lead is also very dense. Be aware of this when moving blocks of lead and do not drop them.

Observe the same precautions when doing an experiment that uses mercury. As with lead, mercury can also be absorbed into the body to accumulate over your lifetime. Mercury 
has the added properties that it is a liquid which can be spilled and any open container of liquid mercury produces mercury vapour which can be inhaled. Avoid spilling 
mercury and try to keep it in a sealed container if possible. Make sure there is a spill tray underneath any experiment that involves the use of mercury. If mercury does get
spilled, notify your instructor so that it can be cleaned up. 

\section{Radiation}
The total dose of radiation you receive depends on the source intensity, the time you are exposed, and your distance from the source. For x-rays and gamma-rays the source 
intensity drops as the inverse square of the distance. For alpha and beta particles the drop is even faster. Minimize the time that a radioactive source is near you. Keep 
radioactive sources  as far away from you as you reasonably can, consistent with doing the experiment. There are strict regulations about the storage and handling of 
radioactive sources. Do not open, drop or lose them.

\section{Lasers}
Lasers are sources of concentrated parallel beams of monochromatic light, which can quite easily be focussed to tiny spots where the power density is high enough to cause 
damage. Never look into a laser beam, or let it shine into your eye, since you may suffer retinal damage if the laser power is high enough. Reflections from polished 
surfaces are almost as dangerous as the direct beam. Never shine a laser into someone elseâs eyes. Resist the temptation to shine the laser around the room or into the 
hallway. If this is done a person could accidentally gaze into the beam.

\section{Rotating Machinery}
Some experiments use pumps, motors, or other moving mechanisms. Keep fingers and other appendages away from such devices. Be especially careful about long hair and 
loose clothing.

\section{Electricity}
Always wire together your circuits with the power off. Make sure the circuit power is off when changing or moving components around. If you must work on live 
circuits only touch the insulated portions and make sure one hand is in your pocket or behind your back. This eliminates the possibility of current flow through the heart 
and lungs, which can be fatal. Do not touch live exposed connections under any circumstances. Beware of loose wires which can fall off or make unintentional connections, 
usually with undesirable results. Be especially vigilant around high voltage circuits. If the voltage is high enough, it is not necessary to touch the circuit to get a 
shock, since sparks can jump across a gap of air. Capacitors require particular care since they can store charge internally for hours after being disconnected from a 
circuit. Make sure capacitors are discharged before touching the terminals. When using spark timers on the air tracks make sure the hands of all your lab partners are clear
before starting the spark source.

\section{Cryogenic Materials}
Some physics experiments involve the use of liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, dry ice, or an organic solvent cooled with dry ice. These materials are cold. Do not touch them 
with your hands. Wear protective gloves when handling a container containing a cryogenic material. Do not splash or spill these cold liquids. Be careful not to touch parts 
that have been in contact with a cryogenic material, they will be cold as well. If a spill does happen, notify your instructor but do not touch the spill, it will evaporate
naturally. There must always be a way for evaporated cryogenic liquid to escape from a vessel, otherwise a dangerous build-up of pressure will occur.

\section{Pressure and vacuum vessels}
Gas bottles are under high pressure. If they are breached they will explode with the force of a bomb. Never jar or mishandle a pressure vessel when it is pressurized. 
Vacuum systems will implode when breached. Do not jar or abuse them either. Always bring the vacuum (or pressure) back to normal slowly. Before adjusting any valves make 
sure you understand the purpose of each valve and the consequences of operating it. Turn it slowly at first so you can change your mind if something seems to be wrong.

\section{Microwaves}
People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting electro-metallic implants should refrain from doing physics experiments that involve microwaves.

\section{Strong Magnetic Fields}
Strong magnetic fields will erase your credit cards, computer disks, and audio tapes. They will also damage watches, tape players, and other electronic devices. Do not leave
any such objects near a strong magnet or electromagnet. Check the area around an electromagnet before turning it on. People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting
electro-metallic implants should also refrain from doing physics experiments that involve powerful magnetic fields. Anything containing a magnet, or magnetic material like 
iron, steel, nickel, or cobalt, should also be kept away from strong magnetic fields. They may be damaged or pulled into the region of the field with enough force to break 
something.

\section{Stroboscopes}
Some people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or severe migraine headaches if they view strobe lights flashing at a frequency of 5 to 25 Hz. Refrain from doing an 
experiment involving strobe lights if you know you are susceptible. Notify the instructor immediately if you see someone adversely affected by an operating stroboscope.

\label{pic:vdResistors}
\end{marginfigure}

The use of electric circuits today is a large part of everyday life. The radio, television, telephone and computer are all examples of devices that use electric circuits. In almost all circuits \textbf{resistors} are among the most common components. Figure \ref{pic:vdResistors} shows some of the many different kinds of resistors. The different shapes and sizes play a role in their behavior and application. Resistors are used to control the current and voltage in a circuit. They were extensively studied by physicists due to this property. Whether it is a complex circuit, such as the ones found in a computer, or one as simple as a battery connected to a light bulb, there are fundamental rules that all resistor circuits follow.			

Georg Ohm (1789-1854) contributed largely to what is now known about resistors. He speculated how current might work and formulated the law governing resistors that now bears his name. Later, Gustav Kirchhoff (1824-1887) made further contributions to the understanding of electric circuits. He extended Ohm's work describing what are now call \textbf{Kirchhoff's Laws}, which explained how current and voltage in electric circuits are related. In 1883 Léon Thévenin (1857-1926), a French telegraph engineer, described what he thought to be a new theory of equivalent circuits. He showed that any resistor circuit could be simplified to make analysis easier. Coincidentally, the concept of equivalency in circuits had already been proposed almost 30 years earlier by the physicist Herman von Helmholtz (1821-1894). Thévenin was unaware of Helmholtz's work and both theories met with resistance during their time. It was due to Thévenins engineering approach, and the growth of electrical engineering in the coming years, that his result is now called \textbf{Thévenin's Theorem}.

\label{fig:vdBasicVD}
\end{marginfigure}

Many combinations of resistors exist in circuitry, but the \textbf{voltage divider} is one combination that is seen everywhere. The circuit in Figure \ref{fig:vdBasicVD} contains a voltage source of some kind, connected in series loop with two resistors. A voltmeter is in parallel with one of the resistors to measure the voltage across it. Each resistor in the loop drops a portion of the voltage. This resistor combination, which accomplishes the splitting of voltages, is called a voltage divider. It can be used to control the voltages coming out of, or going into, a particular system, or even be used as a tool for analysis of circuits.

In Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltDivConnect} the connections of the voltage divider to the voltage source and voltmeter are explicitly shown. The voltage source is supplying a voltage with magnitude V$_{in}$ into the voltage divider and the voltmeter reads V$_{out}$ across R$_{2}$. This suggests the voltage divider can be generalized further by extracting it from the circuit. Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltDivIsolated} shows only the voltage divider. The input voltage, V$_{in}$, can be generalized to be any source of voltage such as a battery, power supply or another device. The output voltage, V$_{out}$, is what would be applied to any device or system connected to these two terminals.

    \caption{Isolated voltage divider}
    \label{fig:vdVoltDivIsolated}
\end{marginfigure}

For the voltage divider in Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltDivIsolated}, V$_{in}$ is split and V$_{out}$ is some portion of V$_{in}$. This can be shown using Ohms and Kirchhoff's laws. From Ohm's law, the voltage drop across a resistor is the product of its resistance and the current through it. So the voltages across R$_{1}$ and R$_{2}$ are V$_{1}$ and V$_{out}$, which are given by

\begin{equation}
V_{1}=IR_{1}
\label{equ:vdV1},
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
V_{out}=IR_{2}
\label{equ:vdVout},
\end{equation}
where I is the current flowing in the loop. From Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, it is expected that the applied voltage equals the voltage drops across all the resistors in series, so that

\begin{equation}
V_{in}=V_{1}+V_{out}.
\label{equ:vdVin}
\end{equation}
Using Equations \ref{equ:vdV1}, \ref{equ:vdVout} and \ref{equ:vdVin}, it is seen that

\begin{equation}
V_{in}=I\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right).
\label{equ:vdVin2}
\end{equation}
Substituting for the current using Equation \ref{equ:vdVout} gives the \textbf{voltage divider formula}

\begin{equation}
V_{out}=V_{in}\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}.
\label{equ:vdVout2}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:vdVout2} implies that the ratio of $\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}$ is equal to the ratio of $\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}$. It also implies that V$_{out}$ cannot be larger than V$_{in}$ since the ratio of one resistor to two resistors can only be equal to or less than one. A special case is seen when R$_{1}$ is zero. The ratio becomes equal to one and V$_{out}$ is equal to V$_{in}$.

   \end{tikzpicture}
   \caption{Variable voltage divider}
   \label{fig:vdVariableVoltDiv}
\end{marginfigure}

The voltage divider in Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltDivIsolated} supplies a fixed voltage ratio. It is also possible for voltage dividers to supply a variable ratio. This is done with a device called a \textbf{potentiometer}. A potentiometer is a variable resistor whose resistance can be changed by turning a dial. Figure \ref{fig:vdVariableVoltDiv} shows a schematic of a potentiometer used as a variable voltage divider. The resistance of the entire potentiometer is R$_{x}$ and R$_{P}$ is the portion of this controlled by the dial. If the dial is adjusted so that R$_{p}$ is equal to R$_{x}$, then V$_{out}$ is equal to V$_{in}$. Likewise V$_{out}$ becomes zero if the dial is adjusted so that R$_{P}$ is zero.

Suppose two more resistors are added to the potentiometer to get the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:vdThreeResistVoltDiv}. The derivation for Equation \ref{equ:vdVout2} involves a loop with two resistors, but in fact can work for any number of resistors. The total series resistance would be on the bottom of the ratio. The output voltage V$_{out}$ could be taken across any or all of the resistors in the circuit and the value of these resistors would go on the top of the ratio. So, the output voltage will be

\caption{Voltage divider with three resistors}
\label{fig:vdThreeResistVoltDiv}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{equation}
V_{out}=V_{in}\frac{R_{P}+R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{x}}.
\label{equ:vdVout3}
\end{equation}
This setup produces a range of voltages for V$_{out}$, which can be controlled by the dial on the potentiometer. The output voltage has a minimum greater than zero and a maximum less than V$_{in}$, as determined by R$_{1}$ and R$_{2}$.The minimum output voltage, V$_{min}$, occurs when R$_{P}$ is zero so

\begin{equation}
V_{min}=V_{in}\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{x}},
\label{equ:vdVmin}
\end{equation}
and the maximum output voltage, Vmax, arises when RP equals Rx which gives

\begin{equation}
V_{max}=V_{in}\frac{R_{x}+R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{x}}.
\label{equ:vdVmax}
\end{equation}

Not only do voltage dividers exist explicitly as the circuits shown in Figures \ref{fig:vdBasicVD}-\ref{fig:vdThreeResistVoltDiv}. They also exist implicitly whenever any two circuits are connected together. There is a division of voltage between the output of any circuit and the input of a second circuit. For example, imagine that a single resistor is connected to a power supply as shown in Figure \ref{fig:vdPowerSupply}. Here, the second circuit is composed of a single resistor R$_{L}$. Typically, R$_{L}$ is called the \textbf{load}, or in this case the \textbf{load resistor}.

Ideally, it would be expected that the entire voltage, V$_{in}$, would be developed across the load resistor. However, what happens in practice is that the voltage across the load, V$_{out}$, is always somewhat smaller than V$_{in}$. Moreover, the smaller the value of R$_{L}$, the larger the discrepancy between V$_{out}$ and V$_{in}$. This situation can be neatly explained by the addition of an internal resistor, R$_{i}$. The voltage is now seen as being split between the load resistor R$_{L}$, and the internal resistance R$_{i}$. The basic voltage divider formula, Equation \ref{equ:vdVout2}, can be used to find V$_{out}$ as before to get

\begin{equation}
V_{out}=V_{in}\frac{R_{L}}{R_{L}+R_{i}}.
\label{equ:vdVout4}
\end{equation}

What is now observable is that the voltage across R$_{L}$ is less than the voltage being supplied by the power supply. If R$_{i}$ is much smaller than R$_{L}$, V$_{out}$ is, to a reasonable approximation, equal to V$_{in}$. At the same time, if the value of R$_{i}$ is close to the value of R$_{L}$, then V$_{out}$ will only be a portion of V$_{in}$. If R$_{i}$ were much larger than R$_{L}$ this effect would be dramatically increased and almost no voltage would be across R$_{L}$. For perfect power supplies R$_{i}$ is zero which means that V$_{out}$ = V$_{in}$ or any load resistor.

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{V_{out}}=\frac{R_{i}}{V_{in}}\frac{1}{R_{L}}+\frac{1}{V_{in}}.
\label{equ:vdVout5}
\end{equation}

With Equation \ref{equ:vdVout5}, R$_{i}$ can be found by connecting a variable load and measuring V$_{out}$ across different load resistances. It can be seen that plotting $\frac{1}{V_{out}}$ versus $\frac{1}{R_{L}}$ yields a straight line with a slope of $\frac{R_{i}}{V_{in}}$ from which R$_{i}$ can be found.

So what is internal resistance exactly? Thévenin answered this by showing that from the point of view of any resistor in a circuit, the rest of the circuit is equivalent to a voltage source with a series internal resistance, just as in Figure \ref{equ:vdVmin}. For example, the left side of Figure \ref{fig:vdTheveninEqu} shows a circuit containing a number of voltage sources and resistors. From the point of view of a single resistor such as R$_{5}$, the entire remaining part of the original circuit is equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor, as shown on the right side of Figure \ref{fig:vdTheveninEqu}. This is called the Thévenin equivalent circuit. The voltage source, V$_{th}$, is called the Thévenin equivalent voltage and the resistor, R$_{th}$, is called the Thévenin equivalent resistance. Comparing this with Figure  \ref{fig:vdPowerSupply}, it is seen that the Thévenin equivalent circuit is a power supply with an internal resistance driving a load consisting of the chosen component, in this case R$_{5}$.

\label{fig:vdTheveninEqu}
\end{figure}

There is a standard procedure for calculating V$_{th}$ and R$_{th}$. The Thévenin equivalent voltage is equal to the voltage that would be found across the terminals without anything attached to it. Here, R$_{5}$ is the reference component so it is replaced with an open circuit. So the voltage across R$_{4}$ is the voltage being output by this circuit and is equal to V$_{th}$. In this example the Thévenin voltage is equal to the product of the current in the second loop, I$_{2}$, and the resistance R$_{4}$. If the value for all the voltage sources and resistors are known, the current across R$_{4}$ can be found by solving for the loop currents. This will yield the Thévenin voltage as being

\begin{equation}
V_{th}=I_{2}R_{4}.
\label{equ:vdVth}
\end{equation}

To find R$_{th}$, R$_{5}$ is again removed and all voltage sources in the circuit are replaced with their internal resistance. In this case the voltage sources are assumed to be ideal and are replaced with short circuits. The Thévenin resistance is then the equivalent resistance at the open terminals. For the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:vdTheveninEqu} this is

\begin{equation}
R_{th}=\left(\left(R_{1}\parallel R_{2}\right)+R_{3}\right)\parallel R_{4},
\label{equ:vdRth}
\end{equation}
where $\parallel$ indicates that the resistors are to be added in parallel.

Another way to measure V$_{th}$ and R$_{th}$ is by knowing that the Thévenin equivalent circuit in Figure \ref{fig:vdTheveninEqu} is identical to the circuit depicted in Figure \ref{fig:vdPowerSupply}. Equation \ref{equ:vdVout5} can therefore be used to find V$_{th}$ and R$_{th}$ by varying R$_{5}$. Here, V$_{out}$ is the voltage across R$_{5}$, and V$_{in}$ and R$_{i}$ are V$_{th}$ and R$_{th}$ respectively. Again, plotting $\frac{1}{V_{out}}$ versus $\frac{1}{R_{5}}$ should yield a straight line. This method produces a graph giving R$_{th}$ and V$_{th}$ from the slope and intercept.

So by attaching a load resistor to a circuit, in the case of Figure \ref{fig:vdTheveninEqu} this was R$_{5}$, the voltage across the resistor is dependent on the internal resistance as explained by the voltage divider rule. The effect that a load resistor has on circuits is called circuit loading.  Imagine the basic voltage divider in Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltDivIsolated} where a voltmeter is used to measure V$_{out}$. Just like the power supply, voltmeters have some internal resistance. In the analysis of Equation \ref{equ:vdVout2}, it was assumed that no current goes into the voltmeter, which is true only for an ideal voltmeter. 

The effect that non ideal voltmeters have on voltage dividers is shown in Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltMeterInternalR}. This schematic is similar to Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltDivConnect} with the exception that the voltmeter now has an internal resistance R$_{i}$. Ideally, the voltage across R$_{2}$ is the ratio of R$_{2}$ to the entire resistance, R$_{1}$ + R$_{2}$. Once a voltmeter is connected, the voltage is split between R$_{1}$ and the combined resistance of R$_{2}$ and R$_{i}$, in parallel. In Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltMeterInternalR}, V$_{r}$ is the voltage read by the voltmeter and V$_{out}$, although not explicitly shown, is the actual voltage across R$_{2}$ without the voltmeter attached.This equivalent resistance is given by

\end{figure}


\begin{equation}
R_{eq}=R_{2}\parallel R_{i}=\frac{R_{2}R_{i}}{R_{2}+R_{i}}.
\label{equ:vdReq}
\end{equation}

It is seen that if R$_{i}$ is much larger than R$_{2}$, then R$_{eq}$ is nearly equal to R$_{2}$, and Equation \ref{equ:vdVout2} still holds. This is what would be expected from an ideal voltmeter. If this is not the case then R$_{eq}$ will be smaller than R$_{2}$. So a larger portion of voltage will develop across R$_{1}$ than before the voltmeter was connected. The voltage measured by the voltmeter will now be smaller than expected. This effect is called meter loading and is seen when R$_{2}$ in Equation \ref{equ:vdVout2} is replaced with R$_{eq}$ to get

\begin{equation}
V_{r}=V_{in}\frac{R_{eq}}{R_{eq}+R_{1}}\neq V_{out}.
\label{equ:vdVr}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:vdVr} gives the output voltage, taking the effect of the voltmeter on the circuit into account. It can be used to calculate the internal resistance of the voltmeter. Furthermore, it is possible to rearrange Equation \ref{equ:vdVr} to find the voltmeter internal resistance by

\begin{equation}
R_{i}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{2}\left(\frac{V_{in}}{V_{r}}-1\right)-R_{1}},
\label{equ:vdRi}
\end{equation}
if R$_{1}$, R$_{2}$ and V$_{in}$ are known, and V$_{r}$ is the reading from the voltmeter.

It has been shown that voltage dividers occur in many circuits containing resistors and/or devices in series. In this experiment several different voltage dividers are examined. A simple voltage divider similar to the one seen in Figure \ref{fig:vdBasicVD} is constructed to examine the voltage divider formula. A potentiometer can then be inserted to check Equations \ref{equ:vdVout3}-\ref{equ:vdVmax}. The power supply can then be probed to find its internal resistance and see the effects of having a power supply with a large internal resistance. Thévenin equivalence can be tested using the three methods previously described, calculation of theoretical values for V$_{th}$ and R$_{th}$, taking direct measurements, and the use of a variable load resistor.

Two multimeters are used in this experiment, the Philips digital meter and the Sanwa analog meter. The Philips multimeter is close to ideal in many situations and is used for most of the measurements in this experiment. The Sanwa multimeter, which is farther from ideal, is used to see the effects of meter loading. The Philips multimeter also has the necessary precision required for observing the small internal resistance of the power supply. 

In this experiment the Philips multimeter is used for taking voltage and resistance measurements. All connections are made to the red V Jack and the black COM jack. Switching between voltage and resistance readings is done via buttons along the bottom of the multimeter, under the display. The DC voltage function is selected by the V\raisebox{0.3 em}{\Beam} button and the resistance function is chosen with the 2W button. For some measurements it may be necessary to change the range of the meter. The three top right buttons on the instrument are the ranging controls. The range can be changed to automatic or manual with the AUT/MAN button. In manual mode the UP and DOWN buttons are used to change the range. Auto ranging is recommended unless otherwise specified in the procedure. When measuring resistance, be sure to disconnect any power supplies from the circuit. The internal resistance of the Philips voltmeter is 10 M$\Omega$.

The Sanwa multimeter is an analog meter with a fairly low input resistance. This multimeter will be used to witness the effect of voltmeter loading. For this experiment the multimeter is in a box and all connections are done using the terminals on the outside of this box. The range can be set using the dial on the front of the device. Useful ranges for this experiment are 0.5 V, 2.5 V, 10 V and 50 V. The internal resistance of the Sanwa multimeter is directly proportional to the voltage range it is reading in and is 20 k$\Omega$/V. For example the internal resistance at the 10 V setting should be 10 V x 20 k$\Omega$/V, which is 200 k$\Omega$.

\item Connect R$_{D}$ = 100 $\Omega$ to the positive output terminal of the power supply. This will show the effects of having a power supply with a high output resistance. Connect a resistance decade box in series to serve as a variable load. The setup should resemble Figure \ref{fig:vdPowerSupply}. Because the 100 $\Omega$ resistor is much larger than the actual internal resistance of the power supply, R$_{i}$ is essentially equal to the value of R$_{D}$. Set the power supply to 1 V. Using the Philips multimeter, take at least 10 measurements of V$_{out}$ while varying the load resistance from 10 $\Omega$  to 10 k$\Omega$.

\item Remove R$_{D}$ from the circuit in step 3. Now, R$_{i}$ is the actual internal resistance of the power supply to be measured. Again set the power supply to 1 V and take measurements, with the Philips multimeter, of V$_{out}$ for load resistance's ranging from  1 $\Omega$  to 10 $\Omega$.

\item Choose one of the circuits in Figures \ref{fig:vdOptA}-\ref{fig:vdOptC} and build it. The Thévenin equivalent voltage and resistance can be found by direct measurements and by calculation. Set the power supply between 1 V and 5 V. Measure V$_{th}$ directly with a voltmeter. Replace the power supply with a short and measure R$_{th}$ directly with an ohmmeter. Remember to disconnect the power from a circuit before taking measurements of resistance with an ohmmeter.

\item Next, use an indirect approach to find the Thévenin equivalent voltage and resistance. Connect a resistance decade box across Vout for the circuit chosen in step 5. This is the load resistor R$_{L}$ and creates a voltage divider between R$_{th}$ and R$_{L}$. Take at least 10 measurements of V$_{out}$ across the load resistor, as the resistance is varied from 10 $\Omega$  to 10 k$\Omega$. Equation \ref{equ:vdVout5} can then be used to deduce the Thévenin equivalent voltage and resistance.
\item Similar to Figure \ref{fig:vdVoltDivIsolated}, a black box containing a voltage divider is provided as seen in Figure \ref{fig:vdBlackBox}. Using resistance measurements only, deduce the contents of the box.
\item Using the same black box as step 7, connect the positive end of the power supply to the red terminal of the black box, and the negative end to the black terminal. Set V$_{in}$ to 3 V and take voltage readings across the red and white terminals. Call this voltage V$_{r}$. Measure V$_{r}$ with the Philips multimeter at voltage ranges 3, 30 and 300.
\item Measure V$_{r}$ with the Sanwa analog meter at voltage ranges 0.5, 2.5, 10 and 50.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}

The wires used are assumed to be ideal, but they do have a small amount of resistance. For some steps such as finding the internal resistance of the power supply, the resistance in the wires may affect the value obtained. Another source of uncertainty arises from the self heating of the resistors when current passes through them. Also for a 5 digit multimeter like the Philips instrument, external noise can be seen in the variance of the lower digits. In this case, the error can be estimated as half the smallest non-varying digit. 

For the Philips multimeter the basic uncertainty of each measurement is dependent on the range it is set to. The accuracy is given in $\pm$(\% of reading + \% of range). At range settings of 300 mV and 30 V the accuracy is 0.0025\% + 0.0013\%, for the 3 V range it is 0.0020\% + 0.0010\%, and for the 300 V range the accuracy is 0.0025\% + 0.0010\%. The accuracy of resistance measurements in the 3 k$\Omega$ and 300 k$\Omega$ range is 0.01\% + 0.0033\%. For the 3 M$\Omega$ range it is 0.02\% + 0.0033\%. The Sanwa multimeter accuracy is given by half the resolution of the scale for that range.

To learn to measure DC and AC voltage with a multimeter and an oscilloscope as well as be able to measure peak-to-peak voltage (V$_{pp}$), peak voltage (V$_p$), average voltage (V$_{avg}$), RMS voltage (V$_{rms}$), and the period of time varying signals. To understand which of these voltage measures is used by multimeters.

\section{{\bf Theory}}
Almost all devices operate and communicate using time-varying electrical signals and therefore, the ability to measure the properties of these signals (amplitude, time variation, etc.) is critical. This experiment gives practice and experience in making these measurements. The theory of DC (signals that do not vary in time) measurements, AC (signals that are time varying ) measurements, and AC with DC (signals ) measurements is presented in sections I, II, and III respectively. The DC signals are generated with a power supply while AC signals are generated with a function generator, which is explained in section IV. These signals are all measured with a standard multimeter as well as an oscilloscope, which is explained in sections V and VI.

A multimeter is a good choice for measuring a steady voltage, such as that across the terminals of a power supply, but an oscilloscope can also be used, provided that great accuracy is not required. It is instructive to measure the terminal voltage of a power supply with both a multimeter and an oscilloscope and compare results as in Figure \ref{fig:acDCoscilloscope}.

As the output voltage of the power supply is increased it can be seen that the multimeter will give a non-zero reading, and that the horizontal line on the oscilloscope will move vertically. Both the reading on the multimeter and the displacement of the trace represent the voltage provided by the power supply. Note that the oscilloscope trace  only moves when the input coupling control is set to DC. In AC coupling mode the DC component of the input signal is blocked and the trace will remain stationary. The oscilloscope only measures voltage, so when current is being measured it should be removed from the circuit.


\section{{\bf II - AC Voltage Measurements}}
An oscilloscope is most useful when measuring time varying signals. Replace the power supply in the circuit with a sine function generator as seen in Figure \ref{fig:acACoscilloscope}. The multimeter reading can now be compared to the oscilloscope display. The trace on the crt display is, of course, a sine wave whose equation is given by

\begin{equation}
V(t)=V_0 sin(\omega t)=V_0sin(2\pi ft)=V_0sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}t\right)

\noindent where $\omega$ is the {\bf angular frequency} (in radians/second), f is the {\bf frequency} (in Hertz), and T is the {\bf period} (in seconds).

There are four ways of describing the height or amplitude of such a wave. These different {\bf amplitudes} can be seen in the sine wave shown in Figure \ref{fig:acSine}.

a) The peak value V$_p$ is the maximum voltage of the waveform. For the sine wave given by Equation \ref{equ:ac1} this  corresponds to V$_0$.

b) The peak to peak value V$_{p-p}$ is the full voltage difference between maximum and minimum values of the voltage. For the sine wave given by Equation \ref{equ:ac1} this equals 2V$_0$.

c) The average value V$_{av}$ over half a period. This value is found from the equation

\begin{equation}
V_{avg}=\frac{2}{T}\int\limits_{0}^{T/2}V(t)dt=\frac{2}{T}\int\limits_{0}^{T/2}V_0sin(\omega t) dt=\frac{2V_0}{\pi}\approx 0.637V_0

d) The effective or {\bf r}oot {\bf m}ean {\bf s}quare (RMS) value, Vrms, is defined as the equivalent dc voltage that will supply the same power, P, to a resistance, R, as the original waveform over a full period. So

\begin{equation}
P=\frac{1}{T}\int\limits_{0}^{T}\frac{V^2(t)}{R}dt=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\frac{V_0^2}{R}sin^2(\omega t) dt=\frac{V_0^2}{2R}
\label{equ:ac3}
\end{equation}

By the above definition, the rms voltage is that dc voltage which would supply the same power to the resistor. Therefore

\begin{equation}
P=\dfrac{V_{rms}^2}{R}=\frac{V_0^2}{2R}
\label{equ:ac4}
\end{equation}

\noindent and thus

\begin{equation}
V_{rms}=\sqrt{RP}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}V^2(t)dt}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}V_0^2sin^2\omega tdt}=\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}\approx 0.707V_0
\label{equ:ac5}
\end{equation}

\section{{\bf III - AC and DC Measurements}}

The offset control on the function generator can be used to add a DC component to the output waveform. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:acSine} where the sine wave is offset vertically. The sine wave can be observed to move up and down on the oscilloscope when the offset control is adjusted. As with the power supply, one can see that the trace will only move when the input controls are set to DC coupling. With AC coupling the DC level is removed and only the sine wave appears on the screen. Similarly, when the multimeter is set to read AC volts or amps, only the AC component is measured. When the multimeter function is DC volts or amps, only the DC level is measured.

The equation of a sine wave together with a DC level is given by

\begin{equation}
V(t)=V_0sin(\omega t)+V_{DC}
\label{equ:ac6}
\end{equation}

Here, the frequency is the same as in Equation \ref{equ:ac1} but the amplitude is different. The sine wave with extra DC component would supply more power to a resistor than the sine wave alone. For the case of a waveform riding on top of a DC level, the rms amplitude is given by the formula

\begin{equation}
Total \hspace{1mm} V_{rms}=\sqrt{(ac\hspace{1mm} rms\hspace{1mm} component)^2+V_{DC}^2}
\label{equ:ac7}
\end{equation}

For the sine wave in Equation \ref{equ:ac6} this formula reduces to

\begin{equation}
Total \hspace{1mm} V_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{V_0^2}{2}+V_{DC}^2}
\label{equ:ac8}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:acSine} shows a sinewave riding on a DC level with the various different amplitudes labeled.






\section{{\bf IV - The Function Generator}}

The function generator is an instrument that generates time varying electrical signals. Front panel controls set the shape, size, rate, and other properties of the output waveform. The B\&K 3011 can generate sine waves, triangle waves, and rectangular waves.

Before connecting the function generator into a circuit, it is essential to make sure that it has been properly configured for the appropriate output signal. Standard practice is to use an oscilloscope to view the output of the function generator directly. Once the wave form is correctly displayed on the screen, the function generator is powered off and connected to the circuit. Do {\bf not} connect an operating function generator to a circuit as it is being wired together. When the circuit wiring is completed, the function generator is powered up, along with any other power supplies and sources that the circuit needs. The function generator {\bf cannot} withstand a short circuit across the output terminals. Always check the circuit you are driving with the function generator to make sure that the output is not being shorted out.

Figure \ref{fig:acFG} shows the operating controls of the function generator. When setting up this instrument, the first task is to choose the appropriate shape (sine, square, or triangle) using the three {\bf FUNCTION} buttons. The waveform appears at the connector labeled {\bf OUTPUT}. The other two output jacks are not commonly used. Secondly, adjust the amplitude of the signal by adjusting the knob labeled {\bf AMPL} to about one quarter of the way between {\bf min} and {\bf max}. The buttons labeled {\bf DUTY}, {\bf OFFSET}, {\bf TTL}, and {\bf AMPL} must all be pushed in. Pulling them out changes the range or adds other functions. The left knob of these four (DUTY) changes the symmetry of the waveform. Make sure this knob is rotated fully counterclockwise to the CAL position. If it is not in the proper position, some output waveforms will appear distorted.

Lastly, it remains to set how often the waveform repeats itself. The push buttons labeled 1, 10, 100, 1K, 10K, 100K, and 1M set the {\bf range} of the repetition rate. Inside any given range the repeat rate is set by the {\bf COARSE} and {\bf FINE} controls. For sine waves these controls adjust the {\bf frequency} of the wave. For triangle waves and rectangle waves, frequency is not an accurate description and the term {\bf repetition rate} is used instead.

\section{{\bf V - The Oscilloscope}}

An oscilloscope is an instrument which usually displays a graph (trace) of the voltage of a signal plotted against time. Time is plotted horizontally, in the x-direction and voltage is plotted vertically, in the y-direction. The graph changes as the voltage changes, so both the waveform and any changes in the waveform can be monitored. Both the voltage scale and the time scale can be adjusted over several orders of magnitude. Measurements of voltages and times can be made by comparing the trace with the transparent scale mounted in front of the screen on which the trace appears. 

The trace is formed by the motion of a bright spot which appears where a narrow electron beam hits the phosphor on the screen of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The electron beam can be deflected in the x and y directions by the electric field caused by amplified signals applied to deflector plates inside the tube. These amplified signals are generated inside the oscilloscope in response to controls the operator sets as well as the actual waveform to be measured. Details of how the CRT works can be found in most books on electricity and magnetism.

\section{{\bf Oscilloscope Controls}}

Even the simplest oscilloscope has several controls, all of which must be set within fairly narrow limits in order to give a good trace. More advanced instruments have additional features and controls which will not be mentioned here. Many oscilloscopes provide dual traces, so that two waveforms can be viewed simultaneously. This makes it easy to compare two signals. Figure \ref{fig:acOscilloscope} shows the controls of a typical oscilloscope.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{/usr/local/master/labs/physics397-FA2016/AC-Measurements/AC-Measurements-osc-controls.png}
\caption{Oscilloscope display panel.}
\label{fig:acOscilloscope}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Basic display controls

(a) {\bf Focus} This controls the size of the spot on the screen, and thus sharpness of the trace which forms the graph. It should be adjusted to give a clear fine image.

(b) {\bf Intensity} This controls the brightness of the spot. If the spot is too dim the Trace is too faint to see. A trace which is too bright will eventually leave a permanent mark on the screen, and in any case tends to smear the trace and hide details. It is good practice to use the lowest intensity that will show all the necessary detail in the trace without straining the eyes.

\item Position controls

These control the horizontal and vertical position of the trace. Usually only small changes are necessary in the horizontal position of the trace. Quite large adjustments may be needed for the vertical position. If no trace is visible on the screen, reduce the vertical gain (see below) or ground the signal using the input coupling controls. Then make sure that the intensity is not too low, and set the x and y position controls to the middle of their range. This will usually bring the spot onto the screen. It may be that the time base is not triggering (see below). Some oscilloscopes have a "beam find" button which can be pushed to locate the trace if it is off screen. This can be a useful time saver.

\item Vertical Gain

The vertical scale of the display is set by the vertical gain control, usually a multi-position rotary switch. The scale is usually given in V/cm (or mV/cm). A dual trace oscilloscope has two independent sets of controls, one for each channel. They are often labeled "Channel A" and "Channel B" or "Channel 1" and "Channel 2". If a continuous control is provided, usually a small knob in the center of the rotary switch, make sure it is turned completely to the "CAL" position before making any measurements.

\item Coupling Controls

The input signal can be connected ("coupled") to the amplifier for the vertical channel(s) either directly (DC coupling) or through a capacitor (AC coupling). A third possibility is to ground the input of the amplifier, which provides a quick way of finding the zero signal position of the trace. AC coupling blocks any DC component of the signal. This is useful when a varying signal is superimposed on a steady voltage, and one wants to zoom in to examine the varying part in detail. If the steady part of the signal needs to be examined then DC coupling is required.

\item Time base

The time base or sweep moves the spot horizontally to the right at a controlled speed, then returns it rapidly to the left of the screen to start again. The sweep or time-base sets the horizontal scale of the display, and is typically controlled by a multi-position rotary switch. The scale is given in s/cm, ms/cm, $\mu$s/cm, and ns/cm. there may be a knob at the center of the rotary switch which gives a continuous change of scale, but which clicks to a preset "calibrated" setting when turned to the far left or right. This control must be in the "calibrated position" before making any measurements of time intervals. It is good practice to check the appearance of the signal at a wide range of time-base settings before starting to make measurements. Some features are best seen at slow speeds while others may show up better at high speeds.

\item Triggering

This controls the time at which the sweep starts. For the display to be steady the sweep should start at the same point on a repetitive signal every time the sweep begins. In this way successive traces will be in the same position.

(a) {\bf Trigger Source} The choices are usually INT ( an internally generated signal being supplied to the horizontal amplifier), EXT (some external signal source), and LINE (the 60Hz line frequency). For most purposes INT is the correct choice. Some signal generators have a SYNC output signal which can be used to trigger the oscilloscope using EXT. The LINE trigger source is used for observing signals that are related to the AC power line. If there is a trigger mode control usually the AUTO setting is the correct one. With dual trace oscilloscopes make sure the trigger source is the appropriate channel. A channel with no signal will give poor triggering.

(b) {\bf Trigger Level} This sets the signal voltage value at which the sweep starts. If an AUTO mode is available try it. If this gives a good trace use that setting. If the AUTO does not give a good trace, usually some experimentation is needed, especially with the LEVEL control. If the LEVEL setting is too low, the sweep will trigger at several different points in the waveform, and the successive traces will not overlap properly, giving an unstable messy display. If the level is set too high, the sweep may not trigger at all, and there will be no trace, or only a dot on the left. One often has to experiment quite a lot to get a good stable trace with certain types of signal. Remember to check that the source of the trigger is the same as the signal you are actually looking at and trying to stabilize. Sometimes the trigger level has to be set carefully at one particular position to give a good stable trace, so perseverance is needed

(c) {\bf Trigger Slope} One can choose whether the sweep will start with a positive- or negative- going  part of the signal. Note that a trigger level alone is not enough to uniquely determine a position on a repetitive signal. The slope at that point must be set as well.
\end{enumerate}

\section{{\bf Experimental Procedure}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:acDCoscilloscope}. Make sure the power supply is initially set to zero volts (voltage knob fully counter-clockwise) and the current knob is turned fully clockwise. Turn on both the oscilloscope and the multimeter. Set up the multimeter to measure DC voltages. Select ranges on both the scope and multimeter for a maximum of approximately 10 to 20 volts. Set the scope to DC coupling so that DC levels can be observed. For at least four different DC voltage levels, measure the output of the power supply with both the multimeter and the oscilloscope.

\item Set up the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:acACoscilloscope}. Connect the multimeter as a voltmeter. Select the sine function on the generator and a frequency of about 1 kHz. To obtain a stationary trace on the scope you will have to adjust both your time base and the frequency. A single period should almost fill the whole screen. Make sure the time base and the vertical gain are both in their calibrated positions or else the numbers you obtain will be incorrect. Make a sketch of what is observed on the oscilloscope screen.

\item For at least four frequencies between 100Hz and 1MHz, measure the frequency of the function generator with both the oscilloscope and the function generator panel meter.

\item The amplitude of the sine wave can be measured with both the multimeter and the oscilloscope and compared. Configure the multimeter for measuring AC voltage. The oscilloscope is naturally suited for measuring the peak-to-peak amplitude of a signal. From this the peak, average, and rms amplitudes can be derived. The point of this step is to deduce which kind of amplitude the multimeter reports. For at least four different amplitudes, measure the amplitude of the sine wave using both the oscilloscope and multimeter. Each of the four sine waves should have a different frequency as well. For best results keep the frequency between 100Hz and 20kHz. 

\item The function generator is not restricted to generating sine waves. It can also generate square waves. For four different amplitudes of a 1kHz square wave, measure the peak and rms voltage of the square wave, using the oscilloscope and multimeter.

\item Note that the DC offset control on the function generator adds a DC level to the output waveform. This suggests that readings can be compared between the multimeter and the oscilloscope for the total rms voltage of a signal with both DC and AC components. For four different amplitudes and DC offsets of a 5kHz sine wave, measure the total rms voltage using both the multimeter and the oscilloscope. It will be necessary to make two measurements with each instrument, one for the DC component and one for the AC component.

\item Determine whether the oscilloscope screen plots from left to right or from right to left. Detail the observations that support your claim.

\item Oscilloscopes can respond to much higher frequencies than multimeters can. Measure the voltage of a sine wave with a multimeter and then increase the frequency until the multimeter has difficulty reporting a voltage. Record how the multimeter and oscilloscope react differently at this frequency.
\end{enumerate}


\section{{\bf Error Analysis}}

The accuracy of digital meters is generally better than that of typical analog meters, but there is always some uncertainty in the calibration of any instrument. Good quality multimeters will have a statement about their accuracy in the instruction manual, or more conveniently, on the case of the instrument itself, typically on the bottom. Suppose now that we have selected the DC current function along with the 200 mA range. The reading is 98.6 mA and we want to find the uncertainty in the reading. To obtain the required information we look on the bottom face of the meter where there is printed information regarding the uncertainty of the various ranges. In the second line we read "DC current  (0.3 + 1)". The +1 inside this bracket means that the last digit in the reading could be any one of 5, 6, or 7 and, hence, that the actual current could be anywhere in the interval

\begin{equation}
98.5\leq I \leq 98.7
\label{equ:ac9}
\end{equation}

The 0.3 indicates that there is an uncertainty of 0.3 \% in the reading due to calibration errors. Taking the worst case (always), we compute the calibration uncertainty in the reading,  I$_C$  as

\begin{equation}
u(I_C)=0.003\times98.7mA=0.3mA
\label{equ:ac10}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
98.5-0.3\leq I\leq 98.7+0.3mA
\label{equ:ac11}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
I=98.6\pm 0.4mA
\label{equ:ac12}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
u(I)=0.4mA
\label{equ:ac13}
\end{equation}

This is the procedure to be followed for computing the uncertainty in any reading made with this multimeter.

The voltage scale and time scale of the oscilloscope both have a calibration uncertainty of 3\%. There is also a reading error of 4\% (half of the smallest division on the screen). Combining these two uncertainties in quadrature results in a measurement error for the oscilloscope of 5\%. This error must be applied for both time measurements (horizontal) and voltage measurements (vertical). The procedure to be followed to compute the uncertainty in any reading made with the oscilloscope is to add an error of 5\% of full scale (not the reading!). This is equivalent to one-half of a major division (or 2.5 times a minor division) for the time scale and a good approximation to one-half of a major division for the voltage scale. Note that this uncertainty is much higher than that of the multimeter.

The digital frequency readout on the function generator has an associated uncertainty of $\pm 1$ digit.

\section{Preparation}
Review reflections of waves in ropes and study basic properties of the wave equation.

\section{Purpose}
To understand some ideas and properties of traveling waves and gain experience with pulse and timing measurements using an oscilloscope. Also, to appreciate the wide range of physical situations where traveling wave ideas apply. 

\section{Theory}
Imagine a rope fixed to a wall and under tension at the free end. When this free end is flipped upwards once a wave travels down the rope until it reaches the wall. Here, the wave exerts a force on the wall and the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the rope. The result is a wave opposite to the original wave traveling back on the rope in the reverse direction. The incident wave has been {\bf reflected} by the wall. As a second example, suppose now that one end of the rope is free to move up and down because it has been connected to a ring that is free to slide on a frictionless rod perpendicular to the rope. Now, when the free end is flipped up once, a wave travels down the rope as before. When this wave reaches the ring the force of the wave raises the ring which then falls back down to generate a wave travelling back down the rope. Unlike the solid wall, this wave is identical to the original wave, instead of opposite.

These two examples demonstrate that a wave on a rope is reflected by both a {\bf fixed rope termination} as well as a {\bf free rope termination}. The fixed and free rope ends are the extreme cases. In an intermediate case, where the rope termination is partly free (or partly fixed), the incident wave will be reflected back with varying intensities and can be opposite or identical, depending on whether the termination is closer to a free end or a fixed end. This logically implies there must be one termination exactly in between which produces no reflection. This {\bf proper termination} occurs when the rope end has a resistance to the wave that is exactly the same as the resistance of the rope itself. From the point of view of the rope, the wave continues onward without interruption because the wave only sees more identical rope ahead. From the point of view of an external observer, the proper termination has absorbed the wave and produced no reflection. This single value of resistance that absorbs waves instead of reflecting them is called the {\bf characteristic impedance}, $Z_0$. If the rope were thinner or more compliant the characteristic impedance would change. 

A second wave property of the rope is the velocity at which the wave propagates along the rope. Giving a harder flip will increase the height of the wave but it will not travel down the rope any faster. This {\bf velocity of propagation}, $V_p$, is dependent on the thickness and compliance of the rope. One can image reversing the rope so the formerly terminated end is now the end to be flipped. The waves will propagate and reflect on the rope the same as before. For the rope then, the characteristic impedance and velocity of propagation are identical for the the forward traveling waves and the reverse traveling reflected waves.

What happens if the rope is flipped twice so that the reflected wave from the first flip must cross the incoming wave of the second flip? The result is determined by a third property of the rope called the {\bf principle of superposition}. This principle states that when two waves overlap, the resulting vertical displacement of the rope (the height or {\bf amplitude}), is the sum of the individual displacements of each wave. The waves themselves do not interfere with each other. After the waves have crossed, each carries on as before without any change in speed or amplitude.

If the rope were ideal, or {\bf lossless}, then the traveling waves would never lose any energy. In practice, a wave traveling on a rope loses a constant fraction of its amplitude per meter of travel along the rope. This {\bf attenuation}, or {\bf loss factor}, of the rope is a fourth characteristic  property of the rope. Due to attenuation, a wave traveling on a very long rope will slowly decay away. In this experiment you will be observing and verifying each of these four properties.

The waves on a rope are an example of a mechanical traveling wave. Traveling wave phenomena occur in any situation where the travel time of a wave along the medium is significantly larger than the size of the wave. Examples of this are everywhere. Bats use acoustic traveling waves in air to locate their prey and avoid obstacles. Dolphins and submarines do the same with acoustic waves in water. The wake from a boat generates surface traveling waves on top of the water that take some time to reach the shore. Striking a hammer on a steel beam generates traveling waves in a solid medium. A sudden application and removal of heat generates a heat wave that travels by conduction. The sudden diffusion that occurs when one material is added to another is also a traveling wave. Lastly, electrical signals in wires and electromagnetic waves in space furnish many examples of traveling waves.

The size and speed of a traveling wave system can vary greatly. The yearly thermal cycle on a concrete dam generates waves with widths in the tens of meters. On the other hand, in a high frequency radar set the waves travel millimeters in a few nanoseconds. This experiment will examine electrical pulses in cables several meters long. The waves will travel the length of the cable in several tens of nanoseconds. This system is used for traveling wave experiments because it closely approximates an ideal traveling wave system. Furthermore, it is easy and fast to make direct measurements on the traveling waves and the cables are small and easily handled. This experiment would not be so easy to perform with yearly thermal waves in a concrete dam.

Let x be the position of the wave and t the time. Then all lossless linear traveling wave systems obey the {\bf telegrapher's equations}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial x}=-\dfrac{Z_0}{V_p}\cdot\dfrac{\partial i}{\partial t}
\label{equ:tw1}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial i}{\partial x}=-\dfrac{1}{V_pZ_0}\cdot\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial t}
\label{equ:tw2}
\end{equation}

Since this experiment deals with electrical pulses on a cable, the variable v represents the voltage and the variable i represents the current. For any other traveling wave system they would represent some other relevant physical quantities. The partial derivatives are required because the wave depends on both the position and the time. Hence the voltage, v, is really a function v(x,t), and the current, i, is really a function i(x,t). The solutions to the telegraphers equations are

\begin{equation}
v(x,t)=f(x-V_pt)+g(x+V_pt)
\label{equ:tw3}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
i(x,t)=\dfrac{1}{Z_0}\left[f(x-V_pt)-g(x+V_pt)\right]
\label{equ:tw4}
\end{equation}

The solution functions f and g are {\bf arbitrary}. This means it does not matter what shape the traveling wave may have, the general behaviour remains unchanged.  Both the f and g functions each satisfy the telegrapher's equations alone. The reason for this is that f and g are arbitrary, so either f or g could be identically zero. This allows us to examine f and g independently. For f, as long as x is increased with velocity, $V_p$ , the value of f(x,t) remains unchanged. So f is a wave traveling in the positive x direction. Similarly, g is a wave traveling in the negative x direction. Set g to zero so the forward wave can be examined. Dividing Equation \ref{equ:tw3} by Equation \ref{equ:tw4} gives

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{v(x,t)}{i(x,t)}=Z_0
\label{equ:tw5}
\end{equation}

\noindent which is a travelling wave version of Ohm's law. For the reverse wave g, the result is

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{v(x,t)}{i(x,t)}=-Z_0
\label{equ:tw6}
\end{equation}

It is now possible to describe reflections quantitatively. Imagine a wave traveling on a cable that is terminated in a load $Z_T$ and has a characteristic impedance $Z_0$. Let $v^+$ be the voltage traveling toward the load and $v^-$ be the voltage reflected from the load. The voltage at the load (terminated end) must be

\begin{equation}
v_T=v^++v^-
\label{equ:tw7}
\end{equation}

\noindent and using Equations \ref{equ:tw5} and \ref{equ:tw6}, the current must be

\begin{equation}
i_T=i^++i^-=\dfrac{1}{Z_0}\left(v^+-v^-\right)
\label{equ:tw8}
\end{equation}

\noindent The voltages and currents at the terminated end are determined by the load $Z_T$, which means

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{v_T}{i_T}=Z_T=\dfrac{v^++v^-}{v^+/Z_0-v^-/Z_0}=Z_0\dfrac{v^++v^-}{v^+-v^-}
\label{equ:tw9}
\end{equation}

\noindent Define the {\bf reflection coefficient} to be the ratio of the reflected voltage to the incident voltage

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_r=\dfrac{v^-}{v^+}
\label{equ:tw10}
\end{equation}

\noindent Using Equation \ref{equ:tw9} this can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_r=\dfrac{Z_T-Z_0}{Z_T+Z_0}
\label{equ:tw11}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:tw11} is our desired result. It predicts what the reflection voltage should be for any type of termination. If the load resistance is equal to the characteristic impedance the reflection coefficient is zero.  When the termination is $Z_T = 0$ (a shorted end), the reflection coefficient is $-1$. When the termination is infinite (an open end), the reflection coefficient is $+1$. This corresponds exactly to what was discussed in the rope example.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Connect the output of the pulse generator to the input of the oscilloscope through the feedthrough termination supplied on the oscilloscope. This termination makes the input of the oscilloscope have the same characteristic impedance as the output of the pulse generator so that reflections are eliminated. Set up the pulse generator for maximum amplitude and minimum pulse width. Adjust the pulse period so that the pulses (waves) are spaced 5 microseconds apart. The remaining pushbuttons on the pulse generator must be in the out position, except for POS and INT LOAD which must be pushed in. The pulse generator is now set up to generate waves that are narrow enough and spaced far enough apart that reflections can easily be observed. Set the horizontal mode of the oscilloscope to MAG with a magnification of $\times$10. 

\item Determine the maximum and minimum values of the pulse. Also, measure the time it takes for the signal to rise from minimum to maximum (the {\bf rise time}), and from maximum to minimum (the {\bf fall time}). Measure the width of the pulse at the half height point. Make two sketches of this wave. One diagram should illustrate a single pulse in detail. The other diagram should illustrate what a train of pulses looks like. Include relevant measurements on the diagrams. 

\item  Connect the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:tw1}. Observe the reflected pulse and determine the time between the initial pulse and the reflected pulse. Also, measure the amplitude of the initial and reflected pulses. From these you will be able to determine the velocity of propagation and the attenuation of the wave medium (the RG58 cable). Draw a diagram. Connect a short circuit termination to the end of the cable. Draw a diagram with relevant measurements for this case. Repeat this step for the RG59 and twinaxial cables.

\item Remove the short circuit termination and connect the variable resistor termination. Adjust the resistor until there is no reflection. Remove the variable termination from the circuit and use the Fluke meter to measure its resistance. This is the value for the characteristic impedance of RG58 cable. Now vary the resistance over its entire range. At each point measure the resistance of the termination and the corresponding amplitude of the initial and reflected waves. Take enough data so that you will be able to verify or refute Equation \ref{equ:tw11}.

\item Remove the variable resistance and leave the cable end open. Increase the pulse width until the outgoing pulse overlaps the reflected pulse. Draw a diagram and take amplitude measurements that will allow you to verify or refute the principle of superposition. Decrease the pulse width back to minimum.

\item Connect the 7.0 m RG59 cable to the end of the RG58 cable. Terminate the open end with a short. Sketch what you observe. Describe what each reflected wave represents. Apply the variable resistive termination to the end of the RG59 cable to measure its characteristic impedance. Repeat with the 7.0 m twinaxial cable. %Measure the velocity of propagation. Repeat with the 7.0 m twinaxial cable. Take enough amplitude data so that you can determine which cable type is lossier, RG59 or twinaxial.

\item Set up the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:tw2}. Connect one end of the 10.0 m RG58 cable to the t-splitter (connected to channel 1) and the other end to channel 2 of the oscilloscope via the feedthrough termination. Set the oscilloscope display to show both channels 1 and 2 and record the voltage differences between the direct output of the pulse generator and the attenuated signal from the cable. Next, measure the time separation between each pulse to determine the phase velocity of the cable. Repeat with the RG59 and twinaxial cables.

\section{Error Analysis}

The uncertainty in measuring the voltage and the time of the wave is the instrument error of the oscilloscope. Assume that the scale on the oscilloscope screen is a ruler. Then the error is one half of the smallest division. Each division in the horizontal direction will have a size determined by the horizontal oscilloscope setting. Similarly, a vertical division is determined by the vertical oscilloscope setting. Take the length of each cable to be exact. For the multimeter, the error is the instrument error as written on the underside of the meter.

\end{enumerate}
%%% end prelab %%%

\section{{\bf Data Requirements}}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item Two diagrams with measurements and errors that show a single pulse at high time resolution and multiple pulses at lower time resolution for the case of a  direct connection between the pulse generator and the oscilloscope. The y axis is voltage and the horizontal axis is time. 

{\it Note: When producing diagrams from the output of the oscilloscope be sure to record the time and voltage scale settings from the oscilloscope so that fiducial markers may be interpreted correctly for reporting of time and voltage differences.}

\item Two diagrams with measurements and errors that illustrate reflections from an open end and a shorted end in the RG58 cable. Explain whether or not  your measurements agree with the predictions of the theory.

\item A value with error for $Z_0$ and $V_p$ for the RG58, RG59, and twinaxial cables as well as a value for attenuation for the RG58 cable. The units of characteristic impedance are Ohms. Express the velocity of propagation as a percentage of the speed of light. Express the attenuation in percentage loss per meter of cable.

\item Knowing $V_p$, add a horizontal position axis to the figures in part 2 so the waves are known in time and space. How wide is the pulse generator pulse in nanoseconds and in meters?

\item A table of values for the variable resistive termination. Include, termination resistance, forward voltage, reflected voltage, measured reflection coefficient, and expected reflection coefficient. To get a more realistic value for the measured reflection coefficient use your data for loss in the RG58 cable to determine better values for the forward and reflected voltage at the terminated cable end.

\item A diagram along with measurements and errors for the case where the outgoing pulse is superimposed on the reflected pulse.

\item Two diagrams for the observed pulses when the RG59 and twinaxial cables are connected to the end of the RG58. No measurements are needed but you need to explain the source for each of the reflections that you observe. 

\section{Discussion}

\item A comparison between the measured and expected values for the characteristic impedance and velocity of propagation of RG58 and RG59 cables.

\item Using the results of procedure step 4, discuss whether your results support or refute Equation \ref{equ:tw11}. 

\item Using the results of procedure step 5, discuss whether your results support the principle of superposition for signals in the cable.

\item Discuss in a paragraph one of the following.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]

\item Technicians who must repair undersea or buried cables use an instrument called a {\bf time-domain reflectometer} (TDR) to find where the cable is cut. TDR uses traveling waves to find cable breaks. Using traveling wave ideas describe how you would find a cable break. Include a hypothetical example together with some numeric calculations.

\item Traveling wave ideas also apply to the flow of automobile traffic. What would a change in the characteristic impedance be caused by? On the highway you encounter a sudden slowdown and shortly thereafter traffic resumes normal speed. No accident or obstruction is anywhere in sight. What has just happened?

\item To characterize large explosions, including nuclear ones, the position and time of the blast front needs to be measured. One way to do this is to have a collapsible cable that crushes flat as the blast moves along. The collapsing end represents a shorted termination that moves along with the explosion. How would you measure the advancing shock front using traveling waves in such a cable?

\section{Preparation}
Review the fundamentals of the Hall effect. The derivation of the Hall voltage is provided in detail in the lab manual.

\section{Purpose}
To learn to calibrate a transducer, in this case a Hall probe, using known standards of magnetic field strength. To learn to identify hysteresis effects in physical systems. Lastly, be able to determine the density of charge carriers and drift velocity in a Hall probe.

\section{Theory}
Transducers are a general class of device that converts variations in a physical quantity into an electrical signal. One well studied example is a {\bf magnetic field transducer}, called a {\bf Hall probe}, which converts magnetic field intensity into potential differences. In this experiment the generation of Hall voltages through the Hall effect is examined. The Hall effect in an InAs semiconductor probe is explained in Section I. Hysteresis and the hysteresis curve of an iron core electromagnet, explained in section II,  are then examined using  a Hall probe. Lastly, the density of charge carriers and their drift velocity in a Hall probe are determined.

\section{I - The Hall Effect}
An investigation into the generation of potential differences across current carrying conductors immersed in a magnetic field, presently known as the {\bf Hall Effect} was initiated by Edwin Hall, then a graduate student, in 1879. The effect is thought to have escaped the attention of other researchers mainly because the potential differences were so small and difficult to measure.

Charges moving with drift velocity , in the presence of both a magnetic field, $\vec{B}$, and an electric field, $\vec{E}$, experience a total force known as the Lorentz force, $\vec{F}$, given by 

\begin{equation}
\vec{F}=\vec{F}_E+\vec{F}_M=q\cdot \vec{E}+q\cdot \vec{\nu}\times \vec{B}
\label{equ:he1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $F_E$ and $F_M$ are the electric and magnetic force vectors respectively and q is the elementary electronic charge. Since charge carriers in a conductor undergo random motion similar to the motion of molecules in a gas, the drift velocity, $\vec{\nu}$, is an average velocity of the charge carriers.

\caption{Current flow through a volume element of a metal or semiconductor.}
\label{fig:he1}
\end{figure}

	As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:he1}, current can be viewed either as a flow of positive charges in one direction or as a flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. If the polarity of the majority charge carriers is negative, the current will be due to the flow of electrons; otherwise it will be due to the flow of holes (positive charges). The direction of flow for positive charges is referred to as the direction of conventional current.
	Charges deflected by the action of the magnetic field, accumulate at the edges of the conductor and a transverse electric field, $\vec{E}$, appears across the conductor. The process of charge deflection and separation continues until the magnitudes of $\vec{F}_E$ and $\vec{F}_M$ have become equal and charges can no longer be deflected against the induced electric field. An equilibrium is established where the total Lorentz force, $\vec{F}$, is equal to zero and a small potential difference, called the {\bf Hall voltage}, appears across the conductor. The polarity of the Hall voltage is determined by the polarity of the charge carriers alone because, as can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:he1}, the magnetic force on a charge carrier of either polarity is always in the same direction. The polarity of the Hall voltage is thus a function of the polarity of the majority charge carriers for that conductor. 
	Another important factor is the relative abundance of carriers of either polarity. In a hypothetical situation, such as the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:he1}, where the ratio of the positive to negative carriers is one to one, the Hall voltage would vanish because of cancellation. Predominance of one type of current carrier, negative or positive is thus essential. The effect could not occur in semiconductors where both types of carriers appear in equal concentrations.
	Prior to Hall's work, conduction in metals was thought to have been caused entirely by a flow of negative charges (electrons). Experiments with various metals have shown, however, that this was not always true. It was discovered that current, in some metals, could be carried by positive charges (holes) not electrons. The phenomenon remained unexplained at the time and came to be known as the {\bf Anomalous Hall Effect}. 
	Semiconductors, unknown at the time of Hall's investigation, exhibit properties similar to those of metals. Here however, the current densities are lower and the Hall voltages are higher than in metals. Since higher voltages are easier to measure, semiconductor Hall probes are routinely used for the measurement of magnetic fields. 
	The information required to find an expression for the Hall voltage is given in Equation \ref{equ:he1}. Since $\vec{F}=0$ at equilibrium, it is true that

\begin{equation}
q\nu B=qE
\label{equ:he2}
\end{equation}

\noindent so

\begin{equation}
\nu B=E
\label{equ:he3}
\end{equation}

\noindent The {\bf Hall voltage}, $V_H$, is then

\begin{equation}
V_H=Ew=\nu Bw
\label{equ:he4}
\end{equation}

\noindent since the potential difference, $V_H$, appearing across the conductor of width $w$, is given by the product of the electric field magnitude and the width of the conductor. Equation \ref{equ:he4} can then be rearranged to read

\begin{equation}
B=KV_H
\label{equ:he5}
\end{equation}

\noindent where K, a proportionality constant, is equal to $1/\nu w$. Equation \ref{equ:he5} illustrates how the Hall voltage can be used in a transducer for the measurement of magnetic fields. If a semiconductor is placed in a magnetic field, then the Hall voltage developed across it can be measured directly with a volmeter. The magnetic field, B, is then found from Equation \ref{equ:he5}. Moreover, since Equation \ref{equ:he5} is linear, once the proportionality constant K is known,  any magnetic field can be determined. The procedure used to find K for a particular transducer is to subject the transducer to a known magnetic field and measure the Hall voltage. The proportionality constant for that transducer then is B/V$_H$. This procedure of {\bf calibrating the transducer} must always be performed before a transducer can be used for making measurements.

Charge carrier density, $n$, defined as the number of charge carriers per unit volume, can be determined from the measurement of the current in a conductor, as current is related to the motion of charged particles. As a rule, charge densities tend to be higher in metals than in semiconductors.

For a volume element , like the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:he2}, it is true that

\begin{equation}
\Delta V=A\Delta x
\label{equ:he6}
\end{equation}

\begin{marginfigure}

\caption{Charge flow through a volume element.}
\label{fig:he2}
\end{marginfigure}

So if the charge carrier density is constant,then $\Delta V$ contains $nA\Delta x$ charge carriers. A {\bf charge element}, $\Delta Q$, contained in the volume element, $\Delta V$, is then given by

\begin{equation}
\Delta Q=nqA\Delta x
\label{equ:he7}
\end{equation}

\noindent where q is the elementary electronic charge, $1.602\times10^{-19}$ C.

For charges moving with drift velocity $\vec{\nu}$, $\Delta x$ is the distance covered in a time interval $\Delta t$. Thus

\begin{equation}
\Delta x=\nu \Delta t
\label{equ:he8}
\end{equation}

\noindent The charge element $\Delta Q$ can now be written as

\begin{equation}
\Delta Q=nqA\nu \Delta t
\label{equ:he9}
\end{equation}

\noindent Dividing both sides of Equation \ref{equ:he9} by $\Delta t$ yields

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=I=nqA\nu
\label{equ:he10}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $I$ is the current flowing through the area $A$. Solving Equation \ref{equ:he10} for drift velocity $\nu$ gives

\begin{equation}
\nu=\dfrac{I}{nqA}
\label{equ:he11}
\end{equation}

\noindent Substituting an expression for the drift velocity $\nu$ from Equation \ref{equ:he4} gives

\begin{equation}
V_H=\dfrac{IBw}{nqA}
\label{equ:he12}
\end{equation}

\noindent As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:he1}, $A$, the cross sectional area of the conductor, is equal to the product of its width, $w$, and thickness, $T$. Equation \ref{equ:he12} can thus be simplified to

\begin{equation}
V_H=\dfrac{IB}{nqT}
\label{equ:he13}
\end{equation} 

\noindent The quantity $1/nq$ is known as the {\bf Hall coefficient}, $R_H$. When the semiconductor is used as a probe to measure magnetic fields, it is excited with a constant current called the {\bf control current}, $I_c$. So $I$ is renamed to $I_c$ and Equation \ref{equ:he13} becomes

\begin{equation}
V_H=R_H\dfrac{I_c}{T}B
\label{equ:he14}
\end{equation}

The sensor element of the Hall probe is made of indium-arsenide. To measure magnetic flux density, the probe is first energized by allowing a steady control current to flow through it. Figure \ref{fig:he3} shows how the Hall sensor probe is connected for the measurements of magnetic fields. The probe is then immersed in a magnetic field such that its direction is perpendicular to the plane of the sensor element.

The Hall voltage that develops across the probe is small, of the order of a few millivolts, so it is good practice to shield it from sources of external noise, which is why a coaxial cable is used. The polarity of the Hall voltage depends on the type of charge carrier active in the semiconductor and can be determined from the polarity of the observed Hall voltage. The polarities of the electrical connections shown in Figure \ref{fig:he3} are in agreement with the sign conventions introduced earlier in Figure \ref{fig:he1}.

The mounting of the semiconductor wafer inside the Hall probe makes it impractical to measure its dimensions directly. For the purposes of this experiment the following dimensions, given by the manufacturer, can be used in the calculations. The thickness of the semiconductor wafer, T, is equal to $(8\pm 1)\times10^{-5}$m. The width of the Hall plate, w, is equal to $(2.03\pm0.01)\times10^{-3}$m. Its length, L, is equal to $(4.57\pm0.01)\times10^{-3}$m.

\section{Magnetic Hysteresis}

All matter is made up of atoms that contain moving electrons. Associated with every atom, there is a tiny {\bf magnetic moment} that is partly due to the orbital motion of the atomic electrons and partly due to their spin. In some materials the magnetic moments remain at random and the substance appears non-magnetic. In others, large numbers of magnetic moments are oriented in some sense or the presence of an external magnetic field causes them to orient in some sense. When this happens, the material becomes {\bf magnetized} and begins to generate its own magnetic field.

\caption{Hysteresis in a magnetized ferromagnetic material.}
\label{fig:he4}
\end{marginfigure}

In ferromagnetic materials, strong interaction between atomic magnetic moments leads to an alignment of these moments in regions called {\bf magnetic domains}, consisting of a large number of magnetic moments. The alignment within the magnetic domains exists even in the absence of an external magnetic field, but the domains are pointed randomly. When an external magnetic field is applied however, the domains tend to orient themselves parallel to the external field, producing a strong net magnetization effect. As the external field intensity is increased, more and more magnetic domains are aligned with the external field increasing the magnetization of the material. At some point virtually all magnetic domains are aligned and the sample reaches a state of {\bf magnetic saturation}. 

If a de-magnetizing field (magnetizing field of opposite polarity) is now applied to the sample, the de-magnetization of the sample lags behind the applied de-magnetizing field. This property, whereby the magnetic flux through the substance does not depend solely on the external magnetic field but also on the magnetic history, is referred to as the {\bf magnetic hysteresis}. When such a substance is subjected to periodic changes in magnetization, the energy dissipated through the production of heat due to the realignment of the magnetic domains, is known as the magnetic hysteresis loss. 

As indicated in Figure \ref{fig:he4}, initial magnetization of a ferromagnetic material corresponds to segment 0-a on the curve. At point a, which corresponds to a maximum on the curve, the material reaches a state of positive magnetic saturation. At this point, all magnetic domains are aligned in the positive direction and increases in the intensity of the magnetizing current have no further effect on the degree of magnetization. Now, as the intensity of the magnetizing current decreases towards zero, the magnetic flux density does not decrease along path a-0. Instead, it decreases along path a-b. This is because some magnetic domains remain aligned and the material retains some degree of magnetization even in the absence of a magnetizing current. The property whereby ferromagnetic materials retain some of their flux density, is referred to as {\bf remanence} or {\bf residual magnetism}. To reduce the remanence to zero, a reverse magnetizing force must be applied. This is accomplished by reversing the magnetizing current (the reverse magnetizing current is sometimes called the de-magnetizing current) and increasing its intensity. With an increase in the reverse current, the flux density drops off to zero along path b-c. The de-magnetizing force required to accomplish this task is called the {\bf coercive force}. As the de-magnetizing force increases beyond point c, the flux density begins to increase in the negative direction, completing segment c-d on the curve. At point d, which represents the minimum on the curve, negative magnetic saturation is reached and all magnetic domains are aligned in the opposite direction. At this point, further increases in the intensity of the de-magnetizing current have no effect on the state of magnetization. The return leg of the magnetization (re-magnetization) process, between points d-e-f-a, is just the reverse of the process described above. It is completed by first decreasing the de-magnetizing force to zero between points d-e, then increasing the magnetizing force in the positive direction between points e-a. The process is complete when the sample returns to its state of positive saturation at point a.

The magnetic field to be measured is generated in an {\bf electromagnet}. Figure \ref{fig:he5} is the the circuit diagram for the electromagnet, power supply, and ammeter. Direct current passing through the coils magnetizes the iron core of the electromagnet and the resultant magnetic flux density is measured in the air gap (see Figures \ref{fig:he5} and \ref{fig:he6}). Since iron is ferromagnetic the characteristics of the magnetic field produced in it are determined by a magnetic hysteresis curve similar to the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:he4}.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Fasten the Hall probe to the lab stand with the extension clamp. Connect the power supply to the control current inputs on the body of the Hall probe, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:he3}. Insert a dual banana plug across the voltage and common terminals of the multimeter. The small rectangular tab on the body of the dual plug indicates ground or common polarity. Make the Hall voltage connection from the coaxial jack on the probe to the multimeter using a coaxial cable. Using a single connecting lead, connect the common terminal of the multimeter to the green grounding terminal of the power supply. This connection is necessary to ensure that the lower contact on the InAs probe is at ground potential while the control current potentials are floating. Do not ground either the positive or the negative terminal of the Anatek power supply as this would place one end of the Hall probe at the same ground potential as the negative end of the probe. As a result, the equipotential lines across the sensor would be skewed, producing a Hall voltage even in the absence of a magnetic field.

\item Have your lab instructor check your circuit before turning on any of the power supplies. Insert the Hall probe into the standard magnet (the magnitude of B$_{cal}$ is stated on the magnet), center it in the gap, and at a constant control current of 150 mA, measure its Hall voltage output to find constant K from Equation \ref{equ:he5}. This calibrates the Hall probe so it can be used to measure other magnetic fields.

\item When K has been determined, set the air gap of the electromagnet to approximately 3.5 mm (see Figure \ref{fig:he6}). Place the Hall probe in the gap and take a series of Hall voltage versus electromagnet current readings (in steps of 0.1 A). Because of the residual magnetism in the core, take the readings for the full range of electromagnet currents in both directions. This means starting from $I=0$ (Figure \ref{fig:he4}), increasing the current to $I=+I_M$, decreasing back to $I=0$, reversing the electromagnet polarity and increasing to $I=-I_M$, decreasing back to $I=0$, reversing the polarity on the electromagnet again, and increasing back to $I=+I_M$. To get stable Hall voltage readings, the electromagnet current should be adjusted gradually, in one direction only.

\item Using the calibrated Hall probe as your measuring instrument, set the magnetic intensity of the electromagnet to 0.2 T. It is necessary to use the same probe control current that was used for probe calibration. Keeping the magnetic field constant at 0.2 T, record a series of Hall voltage versus control current readings over a range of 0 to 150 mA.

\item Make a sketch of the Hall probe, magnetic field and control current orientations with respect to the coordinate axes. Use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic field if necessary. Using the information from Figures \ref{fig:he1} and \ref{fig:he3} and the polarity of the Hall voltage output, find which type of majority charge carrier is responsible for the conduction of current through the probe.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}

A significant source of systematic error lies in the instability of the Hall voltage readings due to the heating of the Hall probe and the electromagnet. Other sources of error may be found in the non-uniformity of the magnetic fields produced in both the electromagnet and calibration magnet air gaps. Further errors may be introduced by non-uniform positioning of the probe in the calibration magnet gap or the tilting of the probe in the electromagnet gap while taking measurements. Such experimental inconsistencies would lead to a measurement of a component of the magnetic flux density instead of the entire flux density. Lastly, there is an error associated with the exact value of the magnetic flux density of the calibration magnet. The experimental uncertainties in I and B are determined from the uncertainties of the measuring instruments and can be readily estimated. The uncertainty in K can be determined from the uncertainties associated with the Hall voltage and the calibration magnetic flux density readings.

\section{Preparation}
Review the theory of RLC resonant circuits. Study the principles of AC signals and their application to resistors, inductors, and capacitors. 

\section{Purpose}
To learn to construct series and parallel RLC circuits and be able to calculate through theory and measurements, the amplitude resonance and the phase resonance of them. Lastly, to learn to measure phase resonance via x-y oscilloscope measurements.

\section{Theory}
The current delivered to homes and factories is an oscillating function of time. This is called {\bf alternating current}, or {\bf AC}. All the appliances connected to ordinary outlets in homes therefore involve circuits with oscillating currents. Furthermore, electronic devices, such as radio transmitters and receivers, involve a variety of circuits with oscillating currents of high frequency. Many of these circuits have natural frequencies of oscillation. Such circuits exhibit the phenomenon of {\bf resonance} when the natural frequency matches the frequency of a signal applied to the circuit. For instance, the tuning of a radio relies on an oscillating circuit whose frequency of oscillation is adjusted by means of a variable capacitor so that it matches the frequency of the radio signal.

A common circuit known as the {\bf RLC circuit} exhibits the phenomenon of resonance. It is named RLC because it includes a resistor, capacitor, and inductor. There are two different kinds of RLC circuit. A {\bf series RLC circuit} is explained in section I and the {\bf parallel RLC circuit} is explained in section II.

\section{I - Series RLC Circuits}
The series RLC circuit used in this experiment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rc1}. The values of resistance, $R_r$, capacitance, C, and inductance, L, are written on the components themselves. The total resistance of the circuit, R, is the sum of the resistances of the resistor, $R_r$, and the inductor, $R_L$.

\end{marginfigure}

Assume that the internal resistance of the function generator can be ignored and choose the input signal to be $v(t)=Esin(\omega t)$, where E is the maximum emf. The emf acts as a driving force that moves the charge in the circuit. An application of {\bf Kirchoff's voltage law} gives

\begin{equation}
\sum V=0=V_L+V_C+V_R-Esin(\omega t)
\label{equ:rc1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
V_C=\dfrac{1}{C}\int i\cdot dt
\label{equ:rc2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
V_L=L\dfrac{di}{dt}
\label{equ:rc3}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
V_R=iR
\label{equ:rc4}
\end{equation}

\noindent are the AC voltages across each component.

Substituting Equations \ref{equ:rc2}, \ref{equ:rc3}, and \ref{equ:rc4} into Equation \ref{equ:rc1} and rearranging gives the expression

\begin{equation}
Esin(\omega t)=\dfrac{1}{C}\int i\cdot dt +L\dfrac{di}{dt}+iR
\label{equ:rc5}
\end{equation}

Differentiating both sides with respect to time, $t$, to remove the integral, yields the differential equation


\begin{equation}
E\omega cos(\omega t)=\dfrac{i}{C}+L\dfrac{d^2i}{dt^2}+R\dfrac{di}{dt}
\label{equ:rc6}
\end{equation}

\noindent The steady state solution of this equation is


\begin{equation}
i(t)=\dfrac{E}{\sqrt{R^2+\left(\omega L-\dfrac{1}{\omega C}\right)}}\cdot sin(\omega t-\phi)
\label{equ:rc7}
\end{equation}

\noindent where


\begin{equation}
\phi=tan^{-1}\left[\dfrac{1}{R}\left(\omega L-\dfrac{1}{\omega C}\right)\right]
\label{equ:rc8}
\end{equation}

The {\bf angular frequency}, $\omega$, is $2\pi f$, where $f$ is the frequency in cycles per second or Hertz (Hz). Equations \ref{equ:rc7} and \ref{equ:rc8} imply that the current flowing in a series RLC circuit is a sine wave with an amplitude that changes with frequency and a phase difference from the signal generator that also changes with frequency. So the behaviour of the circuit strongly depends on the frequency of the applied voltage.

For Equation \ref{equ:rc7}, the current, $i(t)$, becomes an extremum when $\omega^2 = 1/LC$. The condition when the amplitude of $i(t)$ is an extremum is known as {\bf amplitude resonance}. For series RLC circuits, the extremum turns out to be a {\bf maximum}. Thus, at amplitude resonance the current flowing in the circuit has maximum amplitude. At all other frequencies, the current flowing in the circuit is smaller. This property makes the series RLC circuit useful in filters where a response at one frequency is preferred over all other frequencies. This is what happens in radio receivers when one station is selected. The frequency corresponding to the carrier of that station is chosen to be the amplitude resonant frequency.

When $\omega^2 = 1/LC$, Equation \ref{equ:rc8} implies that $\phi = 0$. The condition when $\phi  = 0$ is called {\bf phase resonance}. At phase resonance, the signals at points {\bf d} and {\bf b} in Figure \ref{fig:rc1} are in phase. So there is no phase difference between the applied voltage and the current. In series RLC circuits, amplitude and phase resonance both happen at the {\bf same frequency}. In other types of circuits this is not necessarily true.

\caption{An illustration of phase difference.}
\label{fig:rc2}
\end{marginfigure}

The oscilloscope screen in Figure \ref{fig:rc2} shows two signals that are out of phase. A phase difference between two waveforms is usually reported as an angle. Since horizontal distances on an oscilloscope are in terms of time, a conversion from time to angle has to be made. This is done by noting that the time for a full cycle is 360$^{\circ}$, so the actual phase difference as an angle is found by determining it as a fraction of one cycle and multiplying by 360$^{\circ}$.

To measure a phase difference between two sine waves necessarily implies that they have the same frequency. The phase between two sine waves of different frequency is not constant. Also, notice that the two sinusoidal waveforms depicted in Figure 2 have the same amplitude. This is deliberate. An accurate phase measurement can only made on an oscilloscope when the amplitudes of the signals are the same. Since in general, it is unlikely that any two signals have the same amplitude, a special control is available on the oscilloscope to shift amplitudes without requiring a change to the input signal. This control is called the {\bf vertical calibration} adjustment. To make two signals have the same displayed amplitude simply modify the vertical calibration of one channel. After the phase measurement is completed, remember to return the vertical calibration setting back to normal, otherwise further vertical measurements will be incorrect.

When $i(t)$ becomes an extremum, the input frequency matches the {\bf natural frequency} of the circuit. This is manifested as a voltage extremum on the oscilloscope screen. Thus, when searching for frequencies at which $i(t)$ becomes an extremum, look for frequencies corresponding to a voltage extremum on the oscilloscope screen. The reason for voltage measurements rather than current measurements is due to the fact that the oscilloscope only displays voltages. Moreover, the signal at point {\bf b} is the voltage across the resistor, which is directly proportional to the current by Ohm's law.

\section{II - Parallel RLC Circuits}
The parallel RLC circuit used in this experiment is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:rc3}. The values of resistance, $R_r$, capacitance, C, and inductance, L, are written on the components themselves. Again, the total resistance, R, of the circuit is the sum of the resistances of the resistor, $R_r$, and the inductor, $R_L$.

Again, ignore the internal resistance of the function generator and choose the input signal to have the form $v(t)=Esin(\omega t)$, where E is the maximum emf. This emf acts as a driving force that moves the charge in the circuit. However, in parallel circuits, the behavior of the circuit is given by two simultaneous equations. This is due to the fact that the positions of the inductor and the capacitor are in parallel to each other, thus, the input current splits. Let $i_1(t)$ be the current in the inductive branch and $i_2(t)$ be the current in the capacitive branch. Then {\bf Kirchoff's current law} yields

\begin{equation}
i_{tot}(t)=i_1(t)+i_2(t)
\label{equ:rc9}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, {\bf Kirchoff's voltage law} gives the equations

\begin{equation}
L\dfrac{di_1}{dt}+Ri_1=Esin(\omega t)
\label{equ:rc10}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{i_2}{C}=E\omega cos(\omega t)
\label{equ:rc11}
\end{equation}

These equations have the solution

\begin{equation}
i_{tot}(t)=E\cdot\sqrt{\dfrac{(1-\omega^2LC)^2+(\omega RC)^2}{R^2+(\omega L)^2}}\cdot sin(\omega t+\phi)
\label{equ:rc12}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}
\phi=tan^{-1}\left[\omega RC+\dfrac{\omega^3L^2C}{R}-\dfrac{\omega L}{R}\right]
\label{equ:rc13}
\end{equation}

In the case of the parallel RLC circuit, the amplitude and the phase resonances do occur at {\bf different frequencies}. For the amplitude resonance frequency, $\omega_A$, Equation \ref{equ:rc12} implies that

\begin{equation}
\omega_A^2=\dfrac{1}{LC}\sqrt{1+\dfrac{2R^2C}{L}}-\dfrac{R^2}{L^2}
\label{equ:rc14}
\end{equation}

\noindent whereas, for the phase resonance frequency, $\omega_P$, Equation \ref{equ:rc13} yields

\begin{equation}
\omega_P^2=\dfrac{1}{LC}-\dfrac{R^2}{L^2}
\label{equ:rc15}
\end{equation}

This experiment examines the resonance phenomena of RLC circuits. The circuits to be examined are shown in Figures \ref{fig:rc1} and \ref{fig:rc3}. The input frequency to the circuit is varied to determine at what frequencies resonances occur. Then, the experimental values obtained can be compared with the theoretical values to assess the validity of the resonance theory.

\section{Experimental Procedure} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Inspect the function generator and the dual channel oscilloscope. Make sure that the function generator is set to a sine wave output. Also, set the scope to show both channels on the screen simultaneously as this will be needed to verify the phase resonance of the circuits.

\item Before proceeding further, calculate the theoretical amplitude and phase resonant frequencies for  both the series and parallel RLC circuits using the component values displayed on the circuit boards. This will help the experimental search for resonance frequencies.

\item For the {\bf series RLC circuit}, setup the experiment as in Figure \ref{fig:rc4}. Connect both the function generator and channel 1 of the oscilloscope between {\bf d} and {\bf a}, the input pins. Thus the trace on channel 1 will represent the input signal from the function generator. Connect channel 2 of the oscilloscope between {\bf b} and {\bf a}. The channel 2 trace will then be directly proportional to the current going through the circuit.

On the circuit board there is a red and a black connection terminal. When connecting the function generator and the dual channel oscilloscope onto the circuit board, the common ground on the circuit board is the {\bf RED} terminal, while the common ground on the instruments is the black terminal. The reason for this is that the resistor voltage needs to be measured so the oscilloscope ground has to be connected to point {\bf a}.

\item Find the amplitude/phase resonance by scanning through frequencies near the theoretical value. Stop varying the frequency when the channel 2 trace has its amplitude extremum. Record the experimental resonant frequency from the function generator. Verify that the frequency for amplitude resonance is the same as the frequency for phase resonance ($\phi= 0$).

\item For the resonant frequency and at least 20 other frequencies, some below and some above the resonant frequency, record the peak-to-peak voltage value from the oscilloscope.

\item For the {\bf parallel RLC circuit}, setup the experiment as in Figure \ref{fig:rc5}. Connect both the function generator and channel 1 of the oscilloscope between the red and black input pins (between point {\bf a} and ground). Thus the trace on channel 1 represents the input signal from the function generator. The hidden resistor under the circuit board is a necessity for the output signal to be different from the input signal and to measure the current.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

\item Connect channel 2 of the oscilloscope between {\bf b} and ground. Remember that black lead goes into the black terminal. Also, short out the resistor positioned below the inductor using the shorting wire provided. This is necessary as amplitude resonance is better seen without the resistor since there is less voltage sharing between the inductor and the resistor and the hidden resistor has less effect.

\item Find the amplitude resonance by scanning through frequencies near the theoretical value. Record the experimental resonant frequency from the function generator. 

\item For the resonant frequencies and at least 20 other frequencies, some below and some above the resonant frequencies, record the peak-to-peak voltage value from the oscilloscope.

 \item Remove the shorting wire from the resistor and find the phase resonance. The reason for removing the shorting clip is that the frequency difference between amplitude and phase resonance is magnified for a larger resistance in series with the inductor. There are two common methods for measuring a phase difference. One method was outlined previously. Another technique is to switch the oscilloscope timebase to x-y mode which plots channel 1 versus channel 2 on the screen. When the signals are out of phase a loop appears on the screen. When the two signals are in phase the loop becomes completely closed into a line of positive slope. When the two signals are 180$^{\circ}$ out of phase the loop again closes but this time into a line of negative slope.

\section{Error Analysis}
The internal resistance of the function generator is ignored in this experiment. Consider all values written on the circuit boards as exact. The error in an oscilloscope measurement is half the resolution of the measurement scale. Remember to record which voltage scale and time scale the oscilloscope is set on when recording data. 

There are two errors associated with the function generator frequency. A {\bf drift error} caused by temperature variations inside the function generator and a {\bf quantization error} which is associated with any digital instrument. The drift error can be estimated by observing variations in the output frequency. While you are making measurements, take note of the maximum and minimum frequency values displayed on the function generator. The difference between the maximum and the minimum value divided by two gives the associated drift error. If the function generator has been on for some time then no drift in frequency values may be observable. In this case, the only error associated with the frequency will be the quantization error. 

The error resulting from the conversion of a frequency to a digital display is called the quantization error. Manufacturers usually give the value of this error as plus or minus one number in the smallest digit of the display. The manual accompanying the B \& K Precision Function Generator lists this value as $\pm$1 count.

Take the error in frequency to be the sum of the drift and quantization errors. If, for example, the frequency fluctuates from 767 to 771 Hz in the course of resonance measurments, then the frequency is recorded as 769 Hz and the associated drift error will be $\pm$2 Hz. To take into account the quantization error, add $\pm$1 of the last digit shown on the function generator. Thus, if the last digit shown on the function generator is a ones digit, then the quantization error is $\pm$1 Hz. Therefore, the total error would be $\pm$3 Hz.

\section{Preparation}
Review diffraction. Study the Bohr atom and the Bohr derivation of the Balmer formula. Understand how to convert the energy difference of an electronic transition into a wavelength.

\section{Purpose}
To learn how to calibrate a spectroscope using a spectral source with known wavelengths. To be able to measure wavelengths of spectral lines using a spectroscope.

\section{Theory}
An important issue in all experimental fields of physics is the nature of {\bf calibration}. How can one verify that a measurement device reports accurate values? How does one take readings from a measurement device and convert them to values of interest? For instance, in this experiment, how is the angle of diffraction that a spectroscope provides related and converted to wavelength, which is the desired parameter. In this experiment, the nature of calibration through spectroscopy is explored by setting up a spectroscope and then calibrating it with the spectral wavelengths of Hydrogen. The spectral wavelengths of Hydrogen are a reliable calibration source because these wavelengths are accurately calculated by the theory of quantum mechanics. Therefore, the calibration of the spectroscope is based on the assumption that quantum mechanics is correct. Afterwards, once the spectroscope is calibrated, the spectral lines of more complicated atoms like Helium, Sodium, and Cadmium are measured.

A description of the spectroscope and it's main component, a diffraction grating, are contained in sections I and II respectively. This is followed by a description of spectral lamps and their construction in section III. Lastly, the quantum mechanical description of the Hydrogen atom required for this experiment are contained in section IV, with a more complete version of the theory outlined in the appendix.

\section{I - The Spectroscope}
In 1666, Isaac Newton passed sunlight through a glass prism to observe, what he called, a "spectrum" of colours. It was this experiment that lead to what is now known as {\bf spectroscopy}. Spectroscopy is the study of the electromagnetic spectrum and the emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The science of spectroscopy is useful in many areas that requires the analysis of light. Astronomers use spectroscopy to determine the composition of stars and galaxies. Much of what is known about the Sun comes from the analysis of its spectrum. One of the first to study the Solar spectrum was Joseph von Fraunhofer. In 1814 he found that the spectrum of the Sun contained fine, dark lines which, are now known to be caused by the absorption of light by gases in the Sun. A pattern of dark lines in a continuous spectrum is called an {\bf absorption} spectrum. The opposite, discrete coloured lines on a dark background, is called an {\bf emission} spectrum and is caused by the emission of light by excited atoms.

The spectral lines visible to the human eye vary from violet to red in colour. The most common method of observing spectra is through the use of a {\bf spectroscope}. This type of instrument enables the user to observe the spectrum of various elements and facilitates the measurement of the wavelengths of each spectral line. Figure \ref{fig:sp1} is a diagram of the Introductory Student Spectroscope used in this experiment. Light passes through the {\bf slit} and the {\bf collimator}. It is then bent by the {\bf diffraction grating}. The {\bf Telescope} is connected to a rotatable arm so that it can be moved to allow the bent light to pass through it. A vernier on the telescope is then used to measure the angle at which the incident light is diffracted. Then this angle can be used to find the wavelength of the selected emission line. Encircling the base of the grating table is a 360 degree scale used to make measurements in conjunction with the vernier scale, which is fixed to the telescope arm.

Before the spectroscope can be used to measure the angles of spectral lines it must be adjusted to ensure that accurate results are obtained. To begin, the telescope is focused on a distant object, using the {\bf Telescope focus}. The telescope is then lined up with the slit in the end of the collimator, and the {\bf Collimator focus} is adjusted until the slit comes into sharp focus. In this way only parallel rays of light pass through the {\bf diffraction grating}.

\section{II - Diffraction Gratings}
A diffraction grating is sometimes known as a "super prism". When mixed light passes through a prism the individual wavelengths of light are bent at different angles. A prime example of a prism is raindrops. When sunlight passes through drops of rain it is diffracted, resulting in a rainbow which shows the different colours that make up sunlight. A diffraction grating  can be imagined as a flat surface with thousands of grooves which each act as prism. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:sp2}, the diffraction grating used in this experiment has a sawtooth pattern instead of simple grooves. It can be shown that this pattern, called a {\bf blazed grating}, spreads light away from the centre more effectively than grooves.

When light from an emission spectrum passes through a blazed diffraction grating the light is split into its constituent colours. Atomic spectra are observed as a series of lines because of the constructive interference of the light waves once they have passed through the diffraction grating. Destructive interference produces what is observed between spectral lines, that is, nothing. Constructive interference occurs when two or more waves of light, of equal wavelength, are superimposed in phase, resulting in a maxima, or a spectral line. In order for two identical light waves, diffracted by side by side grooves, to be in phase they must travel a distance that differs by one wavelength after they have been diffracted. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:sp2}, this implies that the distance, p, must be an integer multiple of the wavelength. Therefore for constructive interference the requirement is that

\begin{equation}
dsin\theta=m\lambda\hspace{10mm}m=0,\pm1,\pm2,...

\noindent where d is the {\bf line spacing}, that is, the distance from one point on a groove to the same point on the neighboring groove. Note that the number given on the top of the diffraction grating (600 lines/mm) is the {\bf line density} not the line spacing. Line density is the inverse of line spacing. The {\bf angle of deviation}, $\theta$, is the angle between the central maximum and the spectral line. The variable, m, indicates the {\bf order} of the spectral lines. First order spectral lines ($m=\pm1$) are those found closest to the central maximum. As the telescope arm moves away from the central maximum, a point is reached where the spectral lines begin to repeat. These are known as the second order spectral lines ($m=\pm2$). Although second order maxima are visible, only first order maxima are used in this experiment. The sign of the order is positive or negative depending whether the spectrum is to the right or left of the central maxima. Equation \ref{equ:sp1} can be used to calculate the wavelength of a particular spectral line from the angle of deviation. For example, assuming a line spacing of 1000 lines/mm and a first order angle of deviation of 30$^{\circ}$ a wavelength of 500 nm is calculated.

\section{III - Spectral Sources}
The light from the emission spectrum that passes through the diffraction grating is generated by lamps called {\bf spectral sources}. Three different types of spectral sources are used in this experiment, the Hydrogen and Helium Geissler tubes, the low pressure Sodium lamp, and the Osram Cadmium lamp. In general, the glass parts of spectral lamps should not be touched. Touch only the metal ends of the tube. After a lamp is turned on move it as little as possible so that its lifetime is not shortened. When finished with a light source allow the lamp to cool for at least five minutes before moving it. Once a tube is removed from the power supply store it away immediately before starting to use a different tube. Due to their special nature, spectral lamps are expensive, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars, so they must be treated with care.

In this experiment the spectral lines of Hydrogen, calculated from quantum mechanics, are used to calibrate the spectroscope before confirming the spectral wavelengths of Helium, Sodium, and Cadmium. The accepted wavelengths for the primary visible spectral lines of these elements are presented in Table \ref{tab:sp1}.

Helium Giessler tubes are constructed by filling a glass tube with a pure sample of the desired gas and then adjusting the pressure of the gas to yield maximum brightness. The glass tube is fitted with two electrodes, one at each end. The completed tube is clamped into a high voltage power supply. The high voltage creates an electric field between the electrodes which causes the valence electrons in the atoms to become excited. When the excited electrons lose energy they give off a mixed light containing all wavelengths that are characteristic of the element contained in the tube. Geissler spectral lamps should be turned off when not being used to lengthen their life. Be careful when handling a high voltage supply, do not touch any exposed metal parts. 

The construction of the Low Pressure Sodium tube is more complicated than the Geissler tube. Since Sodium is a solid at room temperature there is insufficient Sodium vapour present for the lamp to be started at any reasonable voltage (less that several thousand volts). It was found that by adding a noble gas mixture of 1.5\% Argon and 98.5\% Neon to the lamp, the starting voltage could be lowered to about 600 Volts. When a cold lamp is turned on a voltage "kick" is supplied to the discharge tube which generates enough charge carriers that the Argon and Neon become conductive. Once conduction begins, the voltage decreases and the discharges remain confined to the noble gases. As the noble gases discharge, heat is generated which eventually causes the Sodium to vaporize. The vaporized Sodium atoms are excited by the electric field present in the lamp. The noble gases are not excited any more because the valence electron of the Sodium is much easier to excite that any of the electrons in the noble gases. When using the Sodium lamp it is important to allow the lamp to warm up for at least ten minutes before making any measurements in order to ensure that the spectrum being measured is actually that of Sodium and not of Neon or Argon. The  Sodium lamp should be left on until all measurements are completed. Turning the lamp on and off will reduce its lifetime, and it is also time consuming as the lamp must be warmed up each time it is turned on.

The Osram Cadmium lamp functions in much the same way as the Low Pressure Sodium Lamp. The main differences are in the noble gas mixture used to start the lamp and the presence of Cadmium instead of Sodium. Do not touch the current setting on the Ealing Power supply. A current of one Ampere is sufficient to obtain a clear spectrum. As with the Low Pressure Sodium lamp, allow the lamp to warm up for at least ten minutes, and leave the lamp on until all measurements have been made.

\section{IV - The Hydrogen Atom}
One of the most commonly studied emission spectra is that of Hydrogen. With the simplest spectrum, Hydrogen is the most basic case of emission and absorption to study. Excited atoms can emit electromagnetic radiation at many wavelengths but for the purposes of this experiment, only the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum is examined. The visible emission spectrum of Hydrogen is known as the {\bf Balmer Series}, named after a Swiss mathematician who first discovered their pattern.

Johann Balmer (1825-1898) was a secondary school mathematics teacher. For many years, scientists sought after a formula to predict the position of the emission lines of hydrogen. As an adept mathematician, Balmer was able to produce a formula that predicts the wavelength of Hydrogen spectral lines with great accuracy. His {\bf Balmer formula} takes the form

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1}{\lambda}=R\left[\dfrac{1}{2^2}-\dfrac{1}{n^2}\right],\hspace{4mm}n=3,4,5,...
\label{equ:sp2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where R is now called {\bf Rydberg's constant} and each integer, n, corresponds to an observed Hydrogen spectrum line. At the time, no one was able to provide an explanation for this formula. A proper explanation was not available until the Danish physicist, Niels Bohr (1885-1962) provided his theory of the atom (see the appendix for details) which demonstrated that

\begin{equation}
R=\dfrac{m_ee^4Z^2}{8\varepsilon^2_0h^3c}
\label{equ:sp3}
\end{equation}

\noindent where Z is the atomic number of the atom. With these equations it is possible to calculate the wavelengths of the visible spectrum lines of the Hydrogen atom.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Remove the diffraction grating and its holder from the spectroscope. It is extremely important not to touch {\bf any} of the lenses or the diffraction grating. If cleaning of any lens on either the telescope or the collimator is required see the laboratory instructor. {\bf Do not use fingers or articles of clothing to clean the optical equipment as this will only result in scratching the optics}. The diffraction grating {\bf cannot} be cleaned at all, so handle it only by its frame.

\item The telescope must be focused for parallel light rays and the crosshairs must be put into focus. First slide the eyepiece on the telescope in or out and bring the crosshairs into sharp focus. Next, focus the telescope on a distant object across the room or out a window.

\item Use the Hydrogen lamp as the calibration light source and place it so that the light from it passes through the slit in the collimator. Aim the telescope at the slit and gently move the lamp until the slit is at its brightest. Adjust the collimator focus until the slit is in sharp focus. In this way the spectrum being measured uses only light parallel to the slit. Align the cross-hairs in the eyepiece with the slit. Do not change the focus of the telescope or the collimator, or rotate the eyepiece for the remainder of the experiment, as this affects the apparent position of the centre slit. Do not move the telescope by touching the eyepiece or the chrome part of the telescope, as this could change the focus of telescope.  

\item Replace the diffraction grating into its holder. The bolts for the diffraction grating holder should be facing the collimator, and the diffraction grating frame should be placed in the holder so that the diffraction grating is as close to the holder as possible. The idea here is that the diffraction grating needs to pass through the centre of the grating table as seen in Figure \ref{fig:sp1}.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Levelling the grating table.}
\label{fig:sp3}
\end{marginfigure}

\item Turn the telescope and look at spectral lines that are far away from the center angle (choose second order lines if possible). Using the three grating table leveling screws on the bottom of the grating table, adjust the level of the table until the lines are vertically in the middle of the telescope as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sp3}. Move the  telescope to the other side of centre and adjust the lines until they are also centered. This adjustment may have be repeated several times on each side.

\item Look through the telescope and adjust the width of the slit. Take note of which side of the slit moves. All measurements should be taken from the side of the light line that {\bf does not} move. By doing this the width of the slit can be changed during the experiment. The slit width adjustment is used to adjust the amount of light that is allowed to pass into the collimator, as different amounts of light are useful in different situations. Some lines are close together and will overlap if the slit is too wide, in which case a narrow slit is required in order to resolve all of the lines that are present. On the other hand some lines are very dim. In such a case a wide slit is better in order for the spectral line to be bright enough that it can be seen.

\item Align the diffraction grating so it is perpendicular to the collimator as seen in Figure \ref{fig:sp2}. This is done by rotating the grating table. If the diffraction grating is not perpendicular, the angle of deviation of the spectral lines will differ between the two sides of the centre maximum. Choose any line in the spectrum and rotate the grating until the angle of deviation is the same on the left spectrum as the right spectrum. This step may need to be repeated several times in order to obtain satisfactory results.   

\item Measure the angle of the centre maximum. Align the cross-hairs with the stationary edge of the slit. Use the vernier to measure the angle of the maximum. A magnifying glass has been provided to assist in reading the vernier. All angles of diffraction are measured with respect to this centre angle. Each angle of diffraction is subtracted from the centre angle and the absolute value of that angle is the angle of deviation. The angle of deviation is then used to determine wavelengths of spectral lines using Equation \ref{equ:sp1}.
 
\item Use the Hydrogen spectral lamp to check the performance of the diffraction grating. The measured angle of deviation, along with Equation \ref{equ:sp1}, can be used to calibrate the spectroscope. If Equation \ref{equ:sp1} holds, a plot of $\lambda$ versus sin($\theta$) should yield a straight line with slope d and an intercept of zero. Using wavelengths calculated in the prelab and measured angles of deviation, make a quick plot of $\lambda$ versus sin($\theta$) (errors need not be included here). Check that the slope of this line is approximately 600 lines/mm.

\item The spectroscope is now adjusted, checked, and ready for analyzing other spectra. Turn on one of the Helium, Sodium, or Cadmium lamps and shine the light through the slit in the collimator. Measure the angle of deviation, on one side of the center maximum, for the lines listed in Table \ref{tab:sp1}.

\item Repeat these measurements for the other two spectral lamps.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}
Usually $u(\theta)$ would be half the smallest division of the vernier on spectroscope, however there are other factors that add to the error. First, it is hard to take measurements from the same part of the spectral line each time a measurement is made. Second, as the eye moves back and forth across the eyepiece the cross-hairs move, therefore in order to get precise measurements the eye would have to be in exactly the same place for each measurement. Third, some lines are not very intense making them hard to see, and lining the cross-hairs up becomes difficult. Fourth, the crosshairs have a thickness which introduces an uncertainty in any visual measurement. Fifth, the condition of the grating, i.e., smudges, scratches, etc., can introduce visual abberrations like smearing. Finally, the spectroscope and diffraction grating used cannot distinguish between spectral lines that are too close together. This is a limitation of the diffraction grating construction as well as the magnification of the telescope. For example, the lines of the Sodium doublet differ by about half a nanometer and they are very close to appearing as one line. For these reasons, take the error in measurements of angles for this spectroscope to be 0.2$^{\circ}$. The uncertainty in the line density of 600 lines/mm for the diffraction grating as given by the manufacturer is unknown, however an error of about 5 lines/mm has been found to be reasonable. Either the manufacturer's line density error of 5 lines/mm, or the line density and error determined by the grating performance check can be used. Note, that {\bf $u(\theta)$ must be in radians} when calculations are being made. All other errors should be propagated using an appropriate method.

\section{Appendix}

One of the most commonly studied emission spectra is that of Hydrogen. With the simplest spectrum, Hydrogen is the most basic case of emission and absorption to study. Excited atoms can emit electromagnetic radiation at many wavelengths but for the purposes of this experiment, only the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum is examined. The visible emission spectrum of Hydrogen is known as the {\bf Balmer Series}, named after a Swiss mathematician who first discovered their pattern.

Johann Balmer (1825-1898) was a secondary school mathematics teacher. For many years, scientists sought after a formula to predict the position of the emission lines of hydrogen. As an adept mathematician, Balmer was able to produce a formula that predicts the wavelength of Hydrogen spectral lines with great accuracy. His {\bf Balmer formula} takes the form

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1}{\lambda}=R\left[\dfrac{1}{2^2}-\dfrac{1}{n^2}\right],\hspace{4mm}n=3,4,5,...
\label{equ:sp4}
\end{equation}

\noindent where R is now called {\bf Rydberg's constant} and each integer, n, corresponds to an observed Hydrogen spectrum line. At the time, no one was able to provide an explanation for this formula. A proper explanation was not available until the Danish physicist, Niels Bohr (1885-1962) provided his theory of the atom.

In 1913 Niels Bohr proposed a theory for atomic structure that was able to account for the observed behaviour of atoms, including Balmer's formula. This theory contained several radical assumptions that violated concepts of classical physics. However, these new assumptions quickly came to be accepted because the theory agreed so well with experimental observations. Bohr assumed that an atom consisted of a massive positively charged nucleus and light negatively charged electrons.

So to explain atomic behaviour, the problem that Bohr addressed was the motion of a single electron about a nucleus of charge Z, where Z is the {\bf atomic number}, the number of protons in the nucleus. Following Bohr, assume that the electron moves in an orbit about the nucleus under the influence of the electrical attraction between the nucleus and the electron. Classically, such an orbiting electron is accelerating and so should radiate away electromagnetic energy continuously. Assume instead, that when an electron remains in a {\bf stable orbit} it does not radiate. Furthermore, assume that the nucleus is so much more massive than the electron, that the electron moves in a perfect circle about the exact center of the nucleus. Under these conditions, the electron follows the rules of classical physics. So the Coulomb attraction is the source of the centripetal acceleration of the orbiting electron, which gives the expression

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\dfrac{e^2Z}{r^2}={m_ev^2}{r}
\label{equ:sp5}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\varepsilon_0 = 8.85418782\times10^{-12}$ C$^2$ N$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$ is the permittivity constant, $e = 1.60217646\times10^{-19}$ C is the electronic charge, r is the radius of the orbit, $m_e = 9.10938188\times10^{-31}$ kg is the mass of the electron, and $v$ is the velocity of the electron.

Moreover, not just any electron orbit is stable. Instead, assume that only certain values of electron orbital angular momentum give rise to stable orbits. The momentum condition for stable electron orbits is given by the expression

\begin{equation}
2\pi m_evr=nh,\hspace{4mm}n=1,2,3,...
\label{equ:sp6}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $h = 6.6260693\times10^{-34}$ m$^2$ kg s$^{-1}$ is Planck's constant. Equation \ref{equ:sp6} implies that electron orbits are quantized. Only certain orbits designated by the natural number n, now called the principal quantum number, are stable.

For each stable orbit, the electron has a fixed amount of energy. The kinetic energy, K, of the electron is found using Equation \ref{equ:sp5} to be

\begin{equation}
K=\dfrac{1}{2}m_ev^2=\dfrac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_0}\dfrac{e^2Z}{r}
\label{equ:sp7}
\end{equation}

\noindent The potential energy, P, of the electron is the amount of work required to completely remove the electron from the nucleus. The work done to move the electron from its orbit to infinity is

\begin{equation}
P=-\int\limits_r^\infty\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\dfrac{e^2Z}{r^2}dr=-\dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\dfrac{e^2Z}{r}
\label{equ:sp8}
\end{equation}

\noindent Since work is needed to move the electron from a lower orbit to a higher orbit, the potential energy is negative. By conservation of energy, the total energy of the electron, E, must be

\begin{equation}
E=K+P=-\dfrac{1}{8\pi\varepsilon_0}\dfrac{e^2Z}{R}
\label{equ:sp9}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{equ:sp5} and \ref{equ:sp6} can be used to eliminate r from Equation \ref{equ:sp9} to yield the result

\begin{equation}
E=-\dfrac{m_ee^4Z^2}{8\varepsilon_0^2h^2}\dfrac{1}{n^2}
\label{equ:sp10}
\end{equation}

So evidently each electron orbit must have a quantized amount of energy specified by the quantum number n. The lowest energy level occurs for $n=1$. Note that the energy function is negative, so as $n$ increases, the energy becomes less negative until it reaches a maximum of zero at $n=\infty$. 

Now suppose that the electron only emits radiation when it changes orbits, somehow moving from a higher stable orbit to a lower stable orbit. Equation \ref{equ:sp10} implies that there must be a change in energy, $\delta$E, for this transition. Assume that the electron emits a photon of energy $\delta$E when the electron changes level. It seems reasonable to propose that the energy of this emitted photon is given by the Planck formula which is

\begin{equation}
\delta E=hf=\dfrac{hc}{\lambda}
\label{equ:sp11}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $c = 2.99792458\times10^8$ m s$^{-1}$ is the speed of light, f is the {\bf frequency} of the photon, and $\lambda$ is the {\bf wavelength} of the photon. Notice that the frequency of the emitted photon has nothing to do with the frequency with which the electron circles the nucleus.

Let the quantum number of the initial orbit be n$_i$ and the quantum number of the final orbit be $n_f$. Then substituting the initial and final energies given by Equation \ref{equ:sp9} into Equation \ref{equ:sp11} gives the result

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1}{\lambda}=\dfrac{m_ee^4Z^2}{8\varepsilon_0^2h^3c}\left(\dfrac{1}{n_f^2}-\dfrac{1}{n_i^2}\right)
\label{equ:sp12}
\end{equation}

\noindent A comparison of Equation \ref{equ:sp12} with Equation \ref{equ:sp4} suggests that the Rydberg constant must be

\begin{equation}
R=\dfrac{m_ee^4Z^2}{8\varepsilon_0^2h^3c}
\label{equ:sp13}
\end{equation}

These results provide an explanation for the spectral lines of the Balmer series. When an atom is excited, by means of heat or otherwise, the increase in energy is accounted for when the electron jumps to a higher energy level. Emission lines result when the electron jumps back down to a lower energy level and emits a photon. In the case of Hydrogen, where Z=1, apparently the visible Balmer lines arise when an electron jumps down to the $n_f=2$ orbit. A comparison of the experimentally derived Rydberg constant with the constant predicted by Equation \ref{equ:sp13} would be a strong test of Bohr's atomic theory.

Figure \ref{fig:sp4} depicts some of the electron transitions in the Hydrogen atom. The figure includes transitions in the ultraviolet ({\bf Lyman series}), the visible ({\bf Balmer series}), and the infrared regions ({\bf Paschen series}) of the spectrum. The energy of each level is indicated on the left side and the respective quantum numbers on the right, as determined by Equation \ref{equ:sp10}. At the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:sp4} is a spectrum describing the location of each of the above mentioned series. The energy difference between each level is the energy an electron must gain in order to jump up to a specific level. Once the electron has jumped up, if it drops back down, a photon is emitted with exactly the same amount of energy as was initially gained. As there are only a specific number of energy levels, the photons created have correspondingly specific wavelengths giving rise to lines in the spectrum. Note that as wavelength increases, each series is similar to the previous one but with smaller line spacing, as seen at the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:sp4}. The Lyman series, with higher energy transitions, is located on the left, with the shorter wavelengths. On the opposite end, the Paschen series has much longer wavelengths as it contains lower energy differences in the transitions.

Each series, however, has an upper bound, known as the {\bf series limit}. For example, the Balmer series would require $n_f$ to be 2 and the Balmer series limit occurs when $n_i=\infty$. Conversely, if an electron initially sitting at $n_i=2$ gains an amount of energy equal to the series limit, called the {\bf ionization energy}, the electron reaches the level $n_{\infty}$. At this point the electron is completely removed from the Hydrogen atom and this Hydrogen atom is said to be {\bf ionized}. A series limit for the Lyman and Paschen series can be obtained similarly, where $n_i=1$ and $n_i=3$ for the Lyman and Paschen series, respectively.

For example, an electron in the $n=3$ energy level dropping to the $n=2$ energy level emits a photon with $3.39-1.51=1.88$ eV. This transition is commonly known as the {\bf H-alpha line}. Planck's formula (Equation \ref{equ:sp11}) gives the wavelength and frequency of the emitted photon. The H-alpha line of the Balmer series is often used for the observation of the fine structure of active regions of the Sun.

\section{Purpose}
To become familiar with the properties of sine waves and sums of sine waves. To gain experience making phase measurements with an oscilloscope. To observe beats. To see how Fourier series are used to synthesize new waveforms.

\section{Theory}
The everyday world is full of sound. All sounds are actually pressure waves transmitted through the air. Since they are waves they can be easily modeled using mathematics. For a pure tone, like a tuning fork, only one {\bf frequency} is required. More complicated sounds, like that of a piano or the human voice, have many more frequencies. One method of describing these waves is to make use of a {\bf Fourier series}. These series are composed of a multitude of sine and cosine functions of differing frequencies and amplitudes. Fourier series are used to deal with problems in such diverse fields as acoustics, geophysics, and astronomy. Although their validity was originally hotly debated, they are now a common and important tool.
	D'Alembert, in 1747, formulated the general equation of a vibrating string. D'Alembert felt that his equations only described smooth vibrations of the string. Euler, on the other hand, argued that the solutions could have sudden jumps and corners because strings can be plucked. Later, in 1753, Daniel Bernoulli formulated a solution of the vibrating string problem based on a series of sines and cosines. This started a debate whether smooth waves could be added up to produce waves with sharp jumps and corners. At first the smoothness problem seemed minor, but this same series began to appear elsewhere. In 1807, Fourier submitted a paper that explained how to use this series to solve problems in heat transfer. This paper was criticized, because researchers did not accept that smooth waves could sum to jagged waves. Later analysts proved that a series sum of smooth functions could indeed produce a non-smooth result. Today, these series of sines and cosines are used routinely and are named {\bf Fourier series} in honour of Jean-Baptiste Fourier.
	Fourier series are based on the sine function. Sine is an example of a {\bf periodic function}. It repeats at a regular interval called the {\bf period}. As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:fs1}, the period, T, is the length of time for one cycle of the wave. The frequency, f=1/T, is the number of cycles in one second. A sine wave has two other parameters that can be varied. The {\bf amplitude}, A, determines the height of the wave. The {\bf phase shift}, $\phi$, is the amount the wave is shifted left or right. Sine waves are depicted mathematically by

\begin{equation}
f(t)=Asin\left( \frac{2\pi}{T}t+\phi\right)

\caption{Phase shifting of a sine wave.}
\label{fig:fs1}
\end{marginfigure}

The quantity 2$\pi$/T=2$\pi$f is known as the {\bf angular frequency}.

Sine waves are added together to form Fourier series. In this light, the addition properties of two sine waves is a special case of Fourier series. If the frequency and the phase are identical, then the amplitude of the sum is the sum of the amplitudes. The frequency and phase remain unchanged. This means that

\begin{equation}
Asin\left( \dfrac{2\pi}{T}t+\theta \right)+Bsin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t+\theta\right)=(A+B)sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t+\theta\right)
\label{equ:fs2}
\end{equation}

The addition of sines with the same frequency but {\bf different} phases introduces new properties. Suppose the two signals are separated by a phase of $\pi$/2. Then

\begin{equation}
Asin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t\right)+Bsin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t+\dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)=Csin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t+\phi\right)
\label{equ:fs3}
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
C=\sqrt{A^2+B^2}
\label{equ:fs4}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\phi=tan^{-1}\left(\dfrac{B}{A}\right)
\label{equ:fs5}
\end{equation}

The amplitude and phase of the sum are now {\bf functions} of the amplitude and phase of the addends and are given by Equations \ref{equ:fs4} and \ref{equ:fs5}. However, the frequency remains unchanged and the sum is still a sine wave. 

When sine waves of different frequencies are added, the sum is no longer a sine wave. For example, if sines of identical amplitude and unequal but close frequency are added, the result takes the form shown in Figure \ref{fig:fs2}. This is the phenomenon known as {\bf beats}. A lower frequency envelope is seen to be riding on the outside of a higher frequency signal, known as a {\bf carrier}, because it "carries" the lower frequency beat signal along.

Mathematically, adding a sine wave of frequency n to a sine wave of frequency m yields the expression

\begin{equation}
sin(nx)+sin(mx)=2sin\left[2\pi\left(\dfrac{m+n}{2}\right)x\right]cos\left[2\pi\left(\dfrac{m-n}{2}\right)x\right]
\label{equ:fs6}
\end{equation}

If m and n are close together, then Equation \ref{equ:fs6} can be thought of as a time varying amplitude applied to a sine wave of frequency (m+n)/2. Although this time varying amplitude has frequency (m-n)/2, Figure \ref{fig:fs2} shows that the frequency at which the minimum value appears is {\bf twice} this amount. So the beat envelope is heard as the {\bf difference frequency} m-n.

The results of Equations \ref{equ:fs2} through \ref{equ:fs6} are found by use of standard trigonometric identities and result in waves that are repetitive in nature. However, the resulting sum of two sine waves {\bf need not repeat itself}. An interesting fact about the addition of different frequencies, m and n, is that the resulting wave is periodic only if m and n are {\bf commensurable}. Two numbers m and n are commensurable if there exists two rational numbers p and q such that

\begin{equation}
pm=qn
\label{equ:fs7}
\end{equation}

If the frequencies m and n are commensurable, then the frequency of the sum is given by the {\bf greatest common divisor} of m and n.

A Fourier series generalizes the sum of two sine waves to the sum of an arbitrary number of sine and cosine waves. Each element of the series can have a different amplitude. However, the frequency of any element must be an integer multiple of one frequency known as the {\bf fundamental}. The integer multiples of the fundamental are known as {\bf harmonics}. Suppose the fundamental has a period T. Then a Fourier series has the form 

\begin{equation}
f(t)=a_0+\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\left(a_ncos\left(\dfrac{2nt\pi}{T}\right)+b_nsin\left(\dfrac{2nt\pi}{T}\right)\right)
\label{equ:fs8}
\end{equation}

The constants $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$... $b_1$, $b_2$... are called {\bf Fourier coefficients}. The most significant property of Fourier series is that {\bf any} function, f(t), that repeats with a period T can be represented by such a series. This includes waves with sudden jumps and sharp corners.

A crucial problem is how to find the Fourier coefficients $a_0$, $a_n$ and $b_n$ for a given function f(t). What Fourier found was a method for determining these coefficients. The Fourier coefficients are calculated by the formulae

\begin{equation}
a_0=\dfrac{1}{T}\int_0^Tf(t)dt
\label{equ:fs9}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a_n=\dfrac{2}{T}\int_0^Tf(t)cos\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)dt
\label{equ:fs10}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
b_n=\dfrac{2}{T}\int_0^Tf(t)sin\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)dt
\label{equ:fs11}
\end{equation}

It can be seen from Equations \ref{equ:fs9}, \ref{equ:fs10}, and \ref{equ:fs11} that the Fourier coefficients for a function f(t) are found by some form of integration over the period T. The reason for this is that certain integrals have the useful property of being zero for all terms of the Fourier series {\bf except one}. They act as a {\bf filter} that preserves one term of the Fourier series and eliminates all the others.

Equation \ref{equ:fs9} suggests that integrating the function and dividing by the period yields $a_o$. Since f(t) has a Fourier series, integrating f(t) gives

\footnotesize
\begin{equation}
\int_0^Tf(t)=\int_0^T\left[a_0+a_1cos\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t\right)+a_2cos\left(\dfrac{4\pi}{T}t\right)+...b_1sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t\right)+...\right]dt
\label{equ:fs12}
\end{equation}
\normalsize

Another useful property of integrals is that each element of a sum can be integrated separately. So,

\small
\begin{multline}
\int_0^Tf(t)=\int_0^Ta_0dt+\int_0^Ta_1cos\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t\right)dt
+\int_0^Ta_2cos\left(\dfrac{4\pi}{T}t\right)dt\\+...\int_0^Tb_1sin\left(\dfrac{2\pi}{T}t\right)dt+...
\label{equ:fs13}
\end{multline}
\normalsize

However, the net area under a full period of any sine or cosine is zero, so all the integrals on the right {\bf vanish} except for $a_o$. This gives

\begin{equation}
\int_0^Tf(t)dt=\int_0^Ta_0dt=Ta_0
\label{equ:fs14}
\end{equation}

Therefore, $a_o$, the first Fourier coefficient, is found to be Equation \ref{equ:fs9}.

The procedure for deducing $a_n$ is nearly identical. Two additional integral properties are needed as filters. It turns out that the integral over a full period of $sin(mx)cos(nx)$ is always zero. Also, the integral over a full period of $cos(mx)cos(nx)$ is always zero {\bf except} when m=n. This filters out all the $a_n$ terms but one.

Using these facts, it can be seen that

\begin{equation}
\int_0^Tf(t)cos\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)dt=\int_0^Ta_ncos^2\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)dt
\label{equ:fs15}
\end{equation}

This reduces to

\begin{equation}
\int_0^Tf(t)cos\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)dt=\dfrac{a_nT}{2}
\label{equ:fs16}
\end{equation}

which gives Equation \ref{equ:fs10}.

The determination of $b_n$ is identical except for the filtering property needed to isolate one $b_n$ term. The integral over a full period of $sin(mx)sin(nx)$ as always zero except when m=n. This gives

\begin{equation}
\int_0^Tf(t)sin\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)dt=\dfrac{b_nT}{2}
\label{equ:fs17}
\end{equation}

Thus, for a given periodic function, f(t), Equations \ref{equ:fs9}, \ref{equ:fs10} and \ref{equ:fs11} can be used to find the Fourier coefficients. Once these are known, the Fourier series can be used to represent or approximate f(t). For example, Figure \ref{fig:fs3} shows a square wave. This signal is not smooth at all. Nevertheless, it has a Fourier series. It turns out that for this square wave $a_0=0$, $a_n=0$ and $b_n=0$ if $n$ is even and $b_n=1/n$ if $n$ is odd. This implies that a square wave is composed of a fundamental sine wave and all of the odd harmonics. Figure \ref{fig:fs3} shows two other signals superimposed on the square wave. One signal is the fundamental, corresponding to the coefficient $b_1$. The other curve is the sum of the first four odd harmonics and the fundamental, namely, $b_1$, $b_3$, $b_5$, $b_7$, and $b_9$.

It can be seen that the shape is converging to a square wave. However, there seems to be a greater difficulty for the Fourier series to track at the discontinuity. There is a sudden jump or overshoot just before each rise and fall. This propensity for a Fourier series to overshoot at the edges is called {\bf Gibb's phenomenon} or {\bf Gibbs Ears}. It turns out that this behavior is a general property of all Fourier series, not just the square wave. In fact, as more terms are added, the ears get narrower but their height {\bf may not decrease}. For the square wave, it can be shown that the height of the ears never falls below 17\% above the square wave level.

This experiment examines the wave phenomena described here using an instrument called a {\bf Fourier Synthesizer}. A Fourier synthesizer is an instrument that creates arbitrarily shaped periodic signals by use of Fourier series. The device generates two sine waves at a fundamental frequency of 440 Hz, as well as eight other harmonic sine waves at frequencies of 880 Hz, 1320 Hz,... up to 3960 Hz. The phase and amplitude of each of these ten signals can be independently adjusted. Any combination of them can be added together. In this way the synthesizer can generate the first nine terms of any Fourier series.

\caption{A Fourier synthesizer.}
\label{fig:fs4}
\end{figure}

The Fourier synthesizer used in this experiment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fs4}. There are ten columns of controls. One column for each of the two fundamentals and eight harmonics. At the top of each column are the phase controls. Two switches select 90$^{\circ}$ and 180$^{\circ}$ phase shifts. The third phase control is continuously variable over a 90$^{\circ}$ range. Together, these three controls provide a full 360$^{\circ}$ phase adjustment range. Below the phase controls is an amplitude control to set the size of the signal. An in/out switch selects whether the column gets added to the output or not. Each column also includes an output point where the signal generated by that column can be measured.

The three primary signal outputs generated by the synthesizer lie below the ten columns. All of the selected columns (those that are switched in) are {\bf added} together and presented at the 10 k$\Omega$ output and the 8 $\Omega$ output. The 10 k$\Omega$ output is connected to an oscilloscope for viewing and measurement of the generated signal  The 8 $\Omega$ output is used to drive a speaker for audible output.

The third output is called a {\bf trigger}. This signal is a square wave locked in phase with the fundamental. The edges of this square wave represent a phase angle of 0$^{\circ}$. This signal serves as a time marker (metronome) against which phases can be measured. Lastly, the reset button is used to periodically resynchronize all the harmonics back together.

The synthesizer can be used to experimentally examine the properties of the addition of sine waves. Equation \ref{equ:fs3} can be examined by adding a sine wave to another phase shifted sine wave of the identical frequency. The amplitude and phase of the sum would be expected to vary in the systematic manner suggested by Equations \ref{equ:fs4} and \ref{equ:fs5}. 

Equation \ref{equ:fs6} and Figure \ref{fig:fs2} can be tested by observing the resulting waveform when sines of identical amplitude but differing frequency are added together. For best results, the chosen frequencies should be relatively close together. This suggests adding together high harmonics such as 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The resulting frequencies of the beat envelope and the beat carrier can be measured with an oscilloscope and compared against Equation \ref{equ:fs6}.

Similarly, Equation \ref{equ:fs7} can be examined by adding together two sinusoids of arbitrary amplitude, phase and frequency. The sum would be expected to have a frequency given by the greatest common divisor, independent of the amplitude and phase. 

Most importantly, Equations \ref{equ:fs9}, \ref{equ:fs10} and \ref{equ:fs11} can be used to find Fourier coefficients for various signals. The coefficients for a wide variety of common signals have been precomputed for implementation on the synthesizer. The selected signals are chosen from a variety of areas of electrical engineering and physics. It should be noted that the resulting shape is quite sensitive to the actual amplitude and phase of each harmonic. For best results, the amplitude of each harmonic should be set using the multimeter and the phase should be set using the oscilloscope.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect the Fourier synthesizer to the oscilloscope. One channel on the oscilloscope is best left connected to the trigger. The second channel on the oscilloscope is used to view the signal output or the individual output of each harmonic, whichever is most useful. The multimeter is connected to the individual output of whichever wave needs to be measured at the time. A common ground should be used between all the equipment. For best results, the oscilloscope should be  AC coupled.

The phase is set using the oscilloscope, by observing the alignment of the sine wave against one edge of the trigger. A phase shift of 90$^{\circ}$ is 90$^{\circ}$/360$^{\circ}$=1/4 of a period. Since the period is 1/440 s, the time shift for 90$^{\circ}$ is $0.25/440570$ s$\approx 570$ $\mu s$. Fix the amplitude of A to some known value using the multimeter. Then, for at least eight different amplitudes of B, measure the amplitude of and phase of the sum. Amplitude is best measured with the AC voltmeter, and phase is best measured with the oscilloscope.

\item Choose any {\bf one} of the following tests for the addition of sine waves of different frequency.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
\item Examine beats as given by Equation \ref{equ:fs6} and Figure \ref{fig:fs2}. Choose any two neighboring higher harmonics and set their amplitudes to be equal and the phases to be 0$^{\circ}$. Measure the frequency of the beat envelope and beat carrier. Repeat for at least two other neighboring harmonics.

\item Examine the sum frequency predicted by Equation \ref{equ:fs7}. Choose any two frequencies with arbitrary non zero amplitudes and arbitrary phase. Measure the period of their sum. The sum frequency can be compared to the expected value given by the greatest common divisor of the individual frequencies. Repeat for at least two other combinations.
\end{enumerate}

\item The synthesizer can generate a 9 term Fourier series for the square wave, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:fs3}. A recipe for synthesizing the square is given in Table \ref{tab:fs1}. To synthesize a particular wave shape, each harmonic 1 through 9 must be set to a particular amplitude and phase. Each amplitude in the table is a percentage relative to a maximum amplitude within the first nine terms. Each phase angle is the number of degrees by which to shift that harmonic. Again, for best results, the AC voltmeter should be used to set the amplitude and the oscilloscope used to set the phase. Synthesize the square wave.

\item Gibbs Ears. Gibbs ears can be measured once the square wave has been synthesized. As each harmonic above number 1 is "switched in" record the height and width of Gibb's ears. This data can be used to check whether the width steadily decreases, while the height goes no lower than 17\%.

\item The following signals are commonly found in sweep circuits, used in radar or television. Synthesize any {\bf one} of the following waveforms. Record the result and note where it is different from the ideal shape. When synthesizing your signal {\bf do not} trust the amplitude dials on the synthesizer. Instead set the amplitudes individually by measuring them with a multimeter.

\item Signals of special form are frequently used in digital communication systems. In digital communications there are a number of standard methods for transmitting binary 'ones' and 'zeros.'  Three of these are {\bf Frequency shift keying} (FSK), {\bf amplitude shift keying} (ASK) and {\bf phase shift keying} (PSK). If ASK is used, one cycle of a sine wave represents a 'one' and a flat line is a 'zero.'  Likewise, FSK represents a 'one' by one cycle of a sine wave and represents a 'zero' by one cycle at a different frequency sine wave. For PSK, a 'one' is designated by one cycle of a zero phase and a 'zero' is one cycle of a 180$^{\circ}$ phase shifted sine wave. Generate any {\bf one} of ASK, FSK, or PSK on the synthesizer using the recipes provided. Record the observed shape and note where there is significant deviation from the ideal desired shape.

\section{Error Analysis}

Generally, the errors in an experiment arise from {\bf systematic errors} in the apparatus and {\bf measurement errors} in the instruments. In this experiment, the measurement errors are determined by the accuracy of the oscilloscope and the multimeter. The systematic errors arise from the behavior and performance of the Fourier synthesizer. The measurement errors of the oscilloscope and multimeter can be readily estimated.

However, there are many possible sources of systematic error lurking inside the synthesizer. The fundamental and harmonic sine waves generated by the synthesizer have some {\bf distortion}. Also, the summation of all the components is not mathematically perfect. Furthermore, the synchronization of the harmonics to each other and to the fundamental is not exact. The magnitude of these and other internal errors is essentially unknown. For this reason error analysis is not required for this experiment.

\section{PreLab}

Do any {\bf two} of the following three questions.
\begin{enumerate}

\item The synthesizer can generate the first nine terms of a Fourier series. This means that once a1 through to $a_9$ and $b_1$ through to $b_9$ are known for a particular signal, that signal can be synthesized. The n'th term of a Fourier series has the form

\begin{equation}
a_ncos\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)+b_nsin\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t\right)
\label{equ:fs18}
\end{equation}

However, the synthesizer does not generate sine and cosine waves. It generates a single wave with adjustable amplitude and phase. Hence, the synthesizer actually generates a Fourier series n'th term of the form

\begin{equation}
A_nsin\left(\dfrac{2n\pi}{T}t+\phi_n\right)
\label{equ:fs19}
\end{equation}

Explain how to find the {\bf amplitude coefficient}, $A_n$, and the {\bf phase coefficient}, $\phi_n$, from the Fourier sine and cosine coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$.
\item Derive Equation \ref{equ:fs10} or \ref{equ:fs11}.

\item The synthesizer does not generate the $a_0$ term. How does this restrict the types of signals that can be synthesized?  What does AC coupling the oscilloscope have to do with the $a_0$ term?

\end{enumerate}

\section{Preparation}
Review the place of x-rays in the electromagnetic spectrum. Understand how a diffraction grating works in an optical spectrometer. Know the Planck energy relation for a quantum of light.

\section{Purpose}
To understand how x-rays are produced and to examine the hypothesis that they are electromagnetic radiation. To be introduced to x-ray crystallography. To understand the source of k-shell x-rays. To get experience with the control and measurement of x-rays and to work with a spectrometer that operates in the x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

\section{Theory}
In the late 19th century physicists and inventors began to work with a new device called a {\bf cathode ray tube}. A cathode ray tube is a glass bulb with the air removed, a hot metal filament at one side, a metallic plate at the other end, and a high voltage between the plate and the filament. This device simultaneously started the eras of modern quantum physics and modern electronics. Among its many other properties, it was noticed that operating such a cathode ray tube at high voltages had a side effect. The cathode ray tube caused various objects outside of the tube to glow. Although other observers had noticed this effect, it was the german physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (1845-1923) who thought it might be important and undertook a systematic study of the phenomenon.

\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{/usr/local/master/labs/physics397-FA2016/X-Ray-Diffraction/X-Ray-Diffraction-handxray.png}
\caption{An x-ray image of a hand.}
\label{fig:xr1}
\end{marginfigure}

Röntgen noticed that the glow persisted even when the cathode ray tube was covered up. He called the unknown emissions originating from the cathode ray tube {\bf x-rays}. A name which remains to this day, although they are also known as Röntgen rays in his honor. Moreover, placing a hand between the glow and the tube cast an eerie shadow that illuminated the bones inside his hand in a different light than the surrounding tissue. Röntgen found that this shadow could be photographed. Figure \ref{fig:xr1} shows one of Röntgen's pictures, one of the earliest x-ray photographs ever taken, dating from 1895. He also found that the x-rays originated in the cathode ray tube at the location where the internal cathode rays struck the metallic plate at the end of the tube. He then established that their degree of penetration through an element depended upon its atomic number. Elements of high atomic number were able to block the x-rays better. Knowing this, he was then able to use slits cut in lead to show that x-rays travel in straight lines and that they are unaffected by electric and magnetic fields. This suggested that the x-rays were a form of electromagnetic radiation similar to light. For his work on x-rays, Röntgen was given the 1901 Nobel prize in physics, the first ever awarded.

If x-rays were similar to light, it seemed reasonable to check whether they exhibit other optical properties of light such as {\bf diffraction}. Diffraction is a wave property of light that makes the edges cast by shadows indistinct instead of sharp and can be used to separate light of different wavelengths. Subsequent investigators had difficulty observing any diffraction and began to suspect that if x-rays were electromagnetic waves like light, they must be of a greatly different wavelength. The german physicist Max von Laue (1879-1960) realized that the spacing of atoms in crystals might be suitable for observing the diffraction of x-rays. His insight was successful and he and his students were the first people to observe {\bf x-ray diffraction} through a crystal. For this work von Laue was awarded the 1914 Nobel prize in physics.

Several more Nobel prizes were earned by physicists studying x-rays. The british son and father team of Sir William L. Bragg (1890-1971) and Sir William H. Bragg (1862-1942) extended von Laue's work. They predicted how x-rays reflect off crystals (a rule now called {\bf Bragg's law} of x-ray diffraction) and used this to design and construct instruments that can examine x-rays by their wavelength. Such instruments are now called {\bf Bragg x-ray spectrometers}. For their work the Bragg's received the 1915 Nobel prize in physics. Further work by the British physicist Charles Barkla (1877-1944) established how x-rays are scattered, polarized, and absorbed. He also discovered that each element emits its own characteristic wavelengths of x-rays which he named {\bf K-shell x-rays}. For this work Barkla received the 1917 Nobel prize in physics. More results on x-ray atomic spectra and still greater refinement of x-ray spectrometers earned the Swedish physicist Karl Siegbahn (1886-1978) a Nobel prize in 1924.

It is now accepted that x-rays are an energetic form of electromagnetic radiation with a much shorter wavelength than light. Ultimately, x-rays became a standard diagnostic tool universally used by astronomers, biologists, chemists, dentists, doctors, engineers, geologists, and physicists. The penetrating nature of x-rays makes it possible to image the interior of living organisms, observe cracks hidden in structures and mechanisms, discern the behaviour of energetic astronomical objects, study the arrangement of atoms in crystals, powders, and alloys, determine the composition of surfaces, and probe the internal energy levels of atomic isotopes.

A point most of these x-ray applications have in common is that they require an x-ray generator, a source of x-rays. Aside from refinements, the {\bf x-ray tubes} used in modern x-ray generators (and the x-ray tube used in this experiment) have the same structure as the original x-ray tubes Röntgen used. Figure \ref{fig:xr2} shows the structure of an x-ray tube. A hot {\bf cathode} inside an evacuated glass tube emits electrons. These electrons are {\bf accelerated} to the other end of the tube by a high voltage and strike the metal target, called the {\bf anode}.  This {\bf electron beam} has enough energy to directly interact with the atoms in the target anode. Most of this energy (about 95\%) is lost in the target as heat. The remainder of the energy is converted into x-rays. The target is {\bf bevelled} to give some directionality to the emitted x-rays. Further control of the x-ray beam path is achieved by a lead glass envelope that blocks x-rays in all directions, except for the {\bf aperture} through which the x-rays are permitted to pass.

The x-rays generated by a typical x-ray tube cover a broad range of wavelengths. The proportion of x-rays at any given wavelength is governed by the physical interaction processes between the electrons in the electron beam and the atoms inside the target. A typical spectrum of x-rays emitted by an x-ray tube is shown in Figure \ref{fig:xr3}. It can be seen that the spectrum exhibits two main features. There is a broad curve at all wavelengths to the right of a certain value. Superimposed on this is a set of sharp peaks. It has been found the shape of the smooth part is determined by the magnitude of the high voltage and the aperture material. The positions and relative sizes of the sharp peaks is determined by the type of atoms the target anode is composed of.

The smooth broad curve is known as the {\bf bremsstrahlung continuum}. This bremsstrahlung radiation, or {\bf braking radiation}, arises due to the acceleration the electrons undergo when they strike the target anode and interact with the electric fields of the atoms inside. Electromagnetic theory predicts that accelerated charges will {\bf radiate} electromagnetic waves. The large number of electrons in the electron beam are all accelerating in different ways since they interact with different atoms of the target at a variety of distances. So the radiated electromagnetic energy happens at many wavelengths and this yields the continuum.

According to the quantum picture, this radiation will be in the form of photons with energy $E = h\nu$ corresponding to the change in the electron kinetic energy $\Delta$ K, so that

\begin{equation}
E=h\nu =\Delta K
\label{equ:xr1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\nu$ is the frequency of the photon, and $h = 6.62606876\times10^{-34}$ Js is {\bf Planck's constant}.

The most energetic possible photon occurs when the electron loses all of its kinetic energy in a single interaction. For an x-ray tube with accelerating voltage, V, the maximum photon energy, E$_{max}$ , and corresponding minimum wavelength $\lambda_{min}$ is

\begin{equation}
E_{max}=h\nu_{max}=\dfrac{hc}{\lambda_{min}}=eV

\noindent where $e = 1.60217646\times10^{-19}$ C is the charge of an electron and c = 299792458 m/s is the speed of light. This highest energy is known as the {\bf cut-off energy} of the x-ray tube. An x-ray tube cannot generate x-rays with higher energy than the cut-off energy. At the low end of the spectrum, it seems reasonable to expect that low energy x-rays would be produced in much greater quantities than high energy x-rays near the cut-off. Theoretically, this is indeed correct as can be seen by the theoretical curve shown in Figure \ref{fig:xr3}. However, in practice, it turns out that the low energy x-rays are not detected in great numbers. The reason for this is that low energy x-rays are easily absorbed. The lowest energy x-rays do not even make it out of the target material. Still more are blocked by the glass walls of the x-ray tube, the air, and the entrance walls of the x-ray detector. This results in the characteristic shape of the bremsstrahlung spectrum seen in Figure \ref{fig:xr3}, where numbers of x-rays are small at low energies, increase to some maximum, and then decrease back down to zero at the cut-off.

The other feature of the x-ray tube spectrum is seen to be the sharp peaks that rise above the bremsstrahlung continuum. These peaks are also due to interactions between the electrons in the electron beam and the atoms in the target. The energy level model of the atom implies that the electrons surrounding the nucleus of an atom have different energy levels called {\bf shells}. Each electron shell has a designated {\bf principal quantum number}, n. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:xr4}, the innermost shell has quantum number n=1 and is commonly called the {\bf K-shell}. The next shell outward has quantum number n=2 and so on. Any transition of an electron from one level to a lower level must be accompanied by the emission of a photon of energy equal to the energy difference between the two levels.

Electrons in the electron beam of the x-ray tube which are sufficiently energetic can penetrate into the atoms and knock an electron out of an inner shell. In turn, an electron from a higher energy level falls down to fill the hole in the inner shell and thereby releases a photon of the corresponding energy difference. So, for example, when an inner electron from the K-shell is removed from the atom, a common transition is for an electron in the next higher shell (n = 2) to move into the inner shell and emit a photon. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:xr4}, this photon is named K$_{\alpha}$. It turns out that for many materials, the K$_{\alpha}$ photon (and many others) happens to have sufficient energy to be an x-ray photon. Each element has a characteristic set of x-ray peaks corresponding to transitions of electrons between inner energy levels. The height of each peak is related to the probability that the particular electron transition corresponding to that energy difference can happen. These {\bf characteristic x-rays} serve as an identifying marker that can be used to identify the target material and explore its inner atomic energy levels.

It is therefore of strong interest to find a method to determine the wavelengths of the features seen in the x-ray spectrum because the actual wavelengths could be used to measure the energy levels of electronic orbitals inside the atom. What is needed is a device that can separate x-rays by their wavelength. For visible light, the device commonly used for this purpose is called a {\bf diffraction grating}. It consists of a large number of equally spaced parallel lines inscribed onto glass. The spacing of the lines is critical to the operation of the grating. For useable results, the separation between the lines should be roughly the same size or smaller than the wavelength of the light to be diffracted. So for visible light with a wavelength around 500 nm, the spacing of the lines needs to be at least 200 lines per millimeter. Unfortunately, it turns out that the wavelength of x-rays is about 1000 times smaller than the wavelength of visible light. It is quite difficult to machine lines fine enough to serve as a diffraction grating for x-rays. However, the spacing between atoms in a regular solid such as a {\bf crystal} serves very well as a {\bf natural} diffraction grating for x-rays.

This natural correspondence between the x-ray wavelength and the spacing of atoms enables crystals to be used as diffraction gratings for x-rays. The study of crystals and x-rays constitutes the scientific field of {\bf x-ray crystallography}. There is a large abundance of different types of crystals, each with their own structure and properties. This experiment restricts its attention to the simplest type of crystal, an ionic solid with a {\bf cubic structure} as seen in Figure \ref{fig:xr5}. The most common example of this type of solid is ordinary table salt, NaCl. Unfortunately, salt crystals have a tendency to absorb water and break down. For this reason, the cubic ionic crystal used in this experiment instead is {\bf Lithium Fluoride, LiF}. As seen in Figure 5, each atom of lithium is surrounded by six fluorine atoms and conversely, each fluorine atom is surrounded by six lithium atoms. All of the atoms are the same distance from each other and this gives rise to the cubic crystal structure.

It seems reasonable to expect that the spacing between the atoms in the LiF crystal influences how the x-rays diffract through the crystal in the same way that the spacing between ruled lines determines how visible light diffracts through an optical diffraction grating. The cubic structure of LiF makes it possible to calculate the distance between the atoms. Let the {\bf atomic mass} of lithium be denoted by A$_{Li}$ and the atomic mass of fluorine be denoted by A$_F$. Then the {\bf molar mass}, A$_{LiF}$, of lithium fluoride is given by

\begin{equation}
A_{LiF}=A_{Li}+A_F
\label{equ:xr3}
\end{equation}

\noindent The number of molecules in A$_{LiF}$ grams of LiF is N$_A$, where N$_A=6.02214199\times10^{23}$ is {\bf Avogadro's number}. If the density of LiF is $\rho$ grams per cubic centimeter, then the volume, V, of N$_A$ molecules of LiF must be

\begin{equation}
V=\dfrac{A_{LiF}}{\rho}
\label{equ:xr4}
\end{equation}

\noindent cubic centimeters. Since LiF is {\bf diatomic}, the {\bf atomic spacing}, d, in centimeters, between the atoms in LiF is

\begin{equation}
d=\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{A_{LiF}}{2N_A\rho}}
\label{equ:xr5}

\caption{A geometrical perspective on x-ray interaction with a LiF substrate.}
\label{fig:xr6}
\end{marginfigure}

To calculate how the diffraction of x-rays happens inside an LiF crystal, assume that the LiF has a cubic structure and that the x-rays actually are electromagnetic waves. The separation, d, between  two neighboring atomic planes is then given by Equation \ref{equ:xr5}. Imagine two x-rays, ray1 and ray2, with wavelength, $\lambda$, reflecting off of two planes of atoms inside the crystal with angle of incidence $\theta$ as seen in Figure \ref{fig:xr6}. For electromagnetic waves, the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, so the reflected ray also leaves the crystal at the same angle $\theta$. If ray1 and ray2 are parallel, then the extra distance travelled by ray2 is the length of the two line segments AB and BC. For {\bf constructive interference} to occur, the distance AB+BC must be an integer multiple of the wavelength. So when x-rays reflect off of the surface of a LiF crystal, each wavelength reflects at a particular angle and all the other wavelengths cancel out. The length of AB is $d\cdot sin(\theta)$, so the condition for constructive interference is

\begin{equation}
n\lambda=2dsin(\theta)\hspace{4mm} n=1,2,...
\label{equ:xr6}
\end{equation}

This formula is known as {\bf Braggs law} and it describes how x-rays diffract when reflected by a cubic crystal. This diffraction interaction is called {\bf Bragg x-ray diffraction} and it implies that a LiF crystal can be used to measure the wavelength of x-rays simply by tilting it at different angles to the x-ray beam.

The instrument that measures an x-ray spectrum by taking advantage of Bragg's law is called a {\bf Bragg x-ray spectrometer}. The construction of a typical Bragg x-ray spectrometer is shown in Figure \ref{fig:xr7}. An x-ray tube generates a beam of x-rays. The x-ray tube is operated by an

\noindent associated high voltage power supply together with control and monitoring electronics. The x-ray beam strikes a mounted crystal at some incident angle $\theta$. Bragg diffraction suggests that the reflected x-rays at the same angle $\theta$ will be at the single x-ray wavelength given by Bragg's law, Equation \ref{equ:xr6}. The reflected beam is detected by an {\bf x-ray detector}. An x-ray detector measures the intensity of the reflected beam. Usually this is done by counting the number of arriving x-ray photons. The x-ray detector also requires its own power supply and control system.

The apparatus is arranged so that the detector can be rotated to any angle $\alpha$. An internal mechanism links the rotation of the detector to the rotation of the crystal. This is done so that for any detector angle, $\alpha$, the crystal is positioned such that the angle of incidence, $\theta$, equals the angle of reflection, $\theta$, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:xr7}. The angle $\alpha$ is always twice the angle $\theta$ so that

\begin{equation}
\alpha=2\theta
\label{equ:xr7}
\end{equation}

\noindent In this way the number of x-rays at any wavelength is determined and when the resulting data is plotted, an x-ray spectrum such as the one in Figure \ref{fig:xr3} is obtained. The crystal spacing and Equation \ref{equ:xr6} can then be used to relate an x-ray wavelength to each angle . Equation \ref{equ:xr6} also suggests that {\bf higher order} spectral features may be visible when $n = 2, 3,...$ . In general, higher order spectra are less bright (a smaller number of x-ray photons) than the primary ($n=1$) spectrum because the extra travel distance through the crystal increases the probablity that the x-ray photon will be absorbed inside the crystal.
	A more detailed view of the Bragg spectrometer actually used in this experiment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:xr8}. The most significant addition to the instrument are {\bf safety interlocks} and {\bf shielding}. Due to their penetrating nature, x-rays are considered to be harmful radiation when received in

\noindent large doses. For this reason, practical x-ray spectrometers are shielded and are equipped with interlocks so that it is impossible to operate the instrument when the shielding is removed. The first layer of shielding is a {\bf dome shield} completely surrounding the x-ray tube and made of leaded glass. An {\bf aperture slit} is mounted in this shield so that a narrow beam of x-rays can escape and strike the diffraction crystal mounted at the center of the x-ray spectrometer. The second layer of shielding are the two lead slits (the {\bf entrance slit} and {\bf collimating slit}) that block the diffracted xrays from escaping the instrument, except for a narrow beam that is permitted to reach the detector. The angular resolution of the x-ray spectrometer is determined by the width of these two slits and the distance between them. The third layer of shielding is the {\bf detector tube} and {\bf detector socket} assembly which absorbs most of the remaining x-rays in the diffracted beam. The fourth layer of shielding is the cover of the instrument. The spectrometer interlocks are designed so that the x-ray tube cannot be energized unless the cover is closed and properly centered. The fifth and final layer of shielding is the {\bf aluminum and lead backstop} that blocks the remaining portion of the direct non-diffracted portion of the x-ray beam. Under normal operation with these safeguards in place, the x-ray spectrometer used in this experiment has been certified as radiologically safe for educational use.

The x-ray spectrometer shown in Figures \ref{fig:xr7} and \ref{fig:xr8} can be used to experimentally examine both the production of x-rays by the x-ray tube and the diffraction of x-rays by the sample cystal mounted in the instrument. The x-ray tube used in this experiment has a {\bf copper} target anode. So it is expected that the K-shell peaks visible in the spectrum should originate from copper atoms and have the characteristic energies of copper. The x-ray tube is operated at a voltage of 30 kV and would be expected to produce a bremsstrahlung spectrum with a cut-off as specified by Equation \ref{equ:xr2} if the theory of braking radiation is correct. The crystal used to diffract the x-rays is lithium fluoride. The density of LiF can be used to deduce the atomic spacing of this crystal assuming a cubic structure. The Bragg spectrometer can then be used to measure the spectrum emitted by the x-ray tube by moving the detector to different angles and recording the x-ray photon count at each angle. If correct, Bragg's law will relate the detector angle to the x-ray wavelength assuming the atomic structure of the crystal is understood. The derived wavelengths of features in the measured x-ray spectrum can be compared with the accepted values to test  Bragg's law and the theory of x-ray production and measurement. Lastly, bremsstrahlung can be further examined by placing a thin piece of plastic in the x-ray beam. If the reason for the long low energy tail is actually due to x-ray absorption, then a piece of plastic should attenuate the low energy part of the spectrum to a much greater extent than the high energy portion. This can be checked by comparing x-ray spectra with and without the plastic against each other.

As is common in spectroscopy, there is a dilemma between accepting the properties of the diffraction grating (in this case a crystal) or accepting the properties of the light source (in this case an x-ray tube). If the grating is trusted, then the grating can be used to measure the spectrum of the incoming x-rays. If the x-ray tube is trusted, then the x-ray beam can be used to examine  the atomic structure of the sample being irradiated. In this experiment, neither device is treated as the accepted standard. Instead, the accepted values for the atomic spacing of  LiF, the K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ wavelengths of copper, and the bremsstrahlung cutoff are compared with the measured values to establish the consistency of the x-ray spectrometer system with x-ray theory. In practice independent evidence is gathered to establish the behaviour of x-ray spectrometers. The structure of LiF is independently deduced by the known chemical properties of ionic solids and the fracture properties of LiF crystals. The wavelengths of x-rays are independently verified without crystals by using ruled gratings that are tilted nearly horizontally to effectively decrease the line spacing of the grating to the point where x-ray diffraction can be obtained.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The apparatus is connected together as shown in Figure \ref{fig:xr7}. Make sure all instruments are turned off before proceeding. The x-ray spectrometer is a nearly self-contained unit except for the x-ray counter and the tube current monitor. The x-ray detector cable should be connected to the \textit{GM tube} input connector on the Tel-Atomic Digicounter. The \textit{monitor tube current} output should be connected to the current jacks on the digital multimeter with the supplied cable. Set the multimeter to a range compatible with a current on the order of 50 $\mu$A DC.

\item The Tel-Atomic Digicounter powers the x-ray detector tube and accumulates and displays the detected x-ray photon counts. For consistent repeatable operation, that enables comparisons between different instruments, the following settings are recommended. The \textit{GM Tube Supply} voltage should be 420 V. The counting switch should be set to \textit{continuous} and the function switch turned to \textit{radioactivity}. Adjust the range switch to \textit{10s}. Set the timing switch to \textit{stop} and the Triggered setting to \textit{off}. The remaining switches and connections can be neglected.

\item The following checks and configurations are recommended for proper operation of the x-ray spectrometer. The names of the various spectrometer parts as used here are shown in Figure \ref{fig:xr8}. First lift the spectrometer cover (shielding cover). This cover has an interlock, so there is a special procedure for opening it. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:xr8}, there are cover interlock presspoints on both sides of the spectrometer at the back. To open the cover, press the right interlock presspoint to shift the entire cover left. The cover can be opened once the cover is shifted fully leftwards. The cover hinge is at the rear, so it is opened by reaching under the backstop shield and raising the opening from the front. Once the cover is lifted, examine the instrument. Do {\bf NOT} touch the crystal, it is brittle and sensitive to moisture, but check that it is present, centered in the sample holder, and the top of it has a dab of blue paint. The blue paint identifies the crystal as LiF. Make sure the x-ray tube is installed and fully covered by the lead-glass dome shield. Inspect the backstop shield to make sure there is a thin plate of lead behind the plate of aluminum on the outside of the cover. Set the high voltage select switch to 30 kV. Check that a 1mm lead aperture slit is installed at the exit port of the x-ray tube. Note that the carriage holding the detector has numbered slots. A 1 mm lead collimator should be present in slot 13 of the detector carriage and a 3mm lead collimator should be installed in slot 18. Lastly, the x-ray detector itself should be installed in slot 26 of the detector carriage.

\item Check that the detector carriage moves freely between 12$^{\circ}$ and 120$^{\circ}$ on the 2$\theta$ scale. For proper operation, the detector carriage must always be on the left side of the instrument as seen in Figures \ref{fig:xr7} and \ref{fig:xr8}. The reason for this is that the crystal has a preferred face where it has been carefully cleaved, and this is the side that should be exposed to the x-ray beam. Verify that the mechanism which rotates the crystal is working correctly. To do this, rotate the detector and compare the reading on the 2$\theta$ scale with the reading on the $\theta$ scale. One should be double the other. The 2$\theta$ scale is read by the scale marker just behind and underneath the detector socket. The $\theta$ scale is read by the angle alignment marker line that is visible on the ring surrounding the sample holder. Next, check the zero alignment of the spectrometer. This is done by rotating the detector to 0$^{\circ}$ on the 2$\theta$ scale. When the zero alignment is correct, the $\theta$ scale should also be registering 0$^{\circ}$ at this point. If there is a mis-alignment, contact the laboratory staff.

\item At this point the instruments are ready to be turned on and the interlocks on the spectrometer checked. Lower the lid and center it using the left and right interlock presspoints. The cover is correctly centered when the front spigot interlock is centered on the the zero angle line. Check (gently) that the cover cannot be opened when it is centered at this position. Turn on the power to the Digicounter and the multimeter. To power up the spectrometer, rotate the timer switch clockwise to the 50 minute mark and then turn on the power switch. The power indicator should light up and the filament inside the x-ray tube should begin to glow. Then press the x-ray button. If the cover is correctly centered, the x-ray indicator should light up and the spectrometer will begin generating x-rays. If the x-ray indicator does not light, it usually implies that the cover needs a minor position readjustment. Once turned on, check the interlock by pressing the right interlock presspoint and shift the lid left. The x-ray indicator should immediately turn off if the interlocks are operating properly. Re-center the cover and turn the x-rays back on. Report to your laboratory instructor and the laboratory staff if the interlock system is not working correctly.

\item Let the x-ray system warmup and stabilize for about fifteen minutes. Monitor the beam current on the multimeter during this time. The accepted range of operation for the x-ray tube is a beam current between 30 and 70 $\mu$A.

\item The spectrometer is now operational. Obtain an x-ray spectrum. At each degree for 2$\theta$ between 12$^{\circ}$ and 120$^{\circ}$ record the ten second x-ray photon counts. The Digicounter automatically repeats ten second measurements so the reset button on the Digicounter is not required. It is sufficient to make sure that a full ten second measurement is made at each angle before moving the detector onto the next angle. Occasionally check the timer switch, and when it nears zero, again turn the time clockwise back up to 50 minutes. For best results keep the spectrometer running continuously for the entire acquisition of the spectrum.

\item Insert a plastic plate between the two collimators on the detector carriage and obtain a second spectrum in the same manner as the first spectrum.

\item Once the second spectrum is completed, turn off the spectrometer and the other instruments.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}
It might be expected that an x-ray spectrum obtained with the Bragg spectrometer used in this experiment would have an appearance something like that shown in Figure \ref{fig:xr3}. This suggests that the x-ray spectra obtained in this experiment are actually graphs of x-ray photon counts versus angle, where the 2$\theta$ detector angle is the independent variable and, N, the number of x-rays, is the dependent variable. As with any graph made from measurements, there will be error bars on each data point reflecting the uncertainty with which it was obtained.

In this experiment, the uncertainty in the angle is dominated by the width of the x-ray beam passing through the instrument. The width of the x-ray beam is determined by the widths and separations of the lead slits in the apparatus. An estimate of the beamwidth can be found by sighting through all of the slits while moving the detector carriage and observing how much the detector must move to each side before the anode of the x-ray tube is blocked. For the instrument used here, it is found that the beamwidth is 3$^{\circ}$ on the 2$\theta$ scale. So the error in 2$\theta$ is 1.5$^{\circ}$ and the error in $\theta$ would be at least half of this. Since there are also alignment errors between rotations of the crystal and rotations of the detector, rounding up the error to the nearest degree seems to be prudent. So a reasonable value to use for $u(\theta)$ would be 1$^{\circ}$.

Additionally, due to the difficulty in observing angles between the physical lower limit of the spectrometer, 2$\theta$=12$^{\circ}$, and the regime of easily measureable angles, 2$\theta\geq$17$^{\circ}$, uncertainties in these small-angle measurements should be chosen appropriately.

The detection of x-rays is a statistical process. Each x-ray photon has a particular probability of being counted by the detector. For this reason, the number of x-rays counts varies, even when the angle remains unchanged. If the x-ray count measurement were repeated a large number of times at each angle, a distribution would be obtained, and the width of the distribution would be a good estimate of the error in the x-ray photon count. However, it is known that for photon counters, the distribution typically is gaussian at large count rates and poissonian at small count rates. In either case, a good estimate of the photon count error, $u(N)$, for both of these statistical distributions is

\begin{equation}
u(N)=\sqrt{N}
\label{equ:xr8}
\end{equation}

Other sources of systematic error are also present. The precision with which the atomic spacing, d, is known affects the precision with which the x-ray wavelengths can be calculated from Bragg's law. Moreover, the purity, quality, and uniformity of the crystal are large factors in the sharpness of the observed features in the x-ray spectrum. If the spacing of the LiF atoms is not identically cubic due to impurities or imperfections, then the analysis of Bragg x-ray diffraction as presented here does not fully apply. Lastly, the photons counted by the x-ray detector do not all arrive from the x-ray beam. Other radioactive sources such as cosmic rays and trace amounts of isotopes in the spectrometer and surroundings contribute as well. These extra sources of photons are called background radiation. For this experiment, errors in the crystal lattice spacing and background radiation can be neglected.

\chapter{Vacuum Technology Laboratory}

The production of low-pressure environments is important for many research activities because it isolates an experiment from the surroundings. This is essential because some materials react if exposed to air, either by slow oxidation or something more violent. In other cases, it is a process, such as thin layer deposition, which is affected by the presence or lack of air. Often it is thermal isolation that is being sought and there is no more efficient thermal insulator than a perfect vacuum. In optical sciences, certain wavelength regions, referred to as the vacuum ultraviolet, extreme ultraviolet, and parts of the far infrared region, employ photons that are absorbed by air. It would not be possible to work in these regions without a good vacuum system. Other optical processes are disguised or even destroyed by rapid collisions with air molecules, and thus high vacuum is needed. In summary, many studies in atomic and molecular, condensed matter, laser, nuclear, optical, particle, plasma, and quantum physics are only possible with the use of vacuum systems. In addition, many applied areas such as thin film deposition, and etching are possible only at low pressures.

Working with vacuum systems is interesting and challenging. The equipment is often easily damaged, and in some cases, specifically when working with liquid nitrogen, can be somewhat hazardous to its operators. Please ask your TA for help if you are at all unsure of what you are doing. We will be happy to show you how to work the equipment, more than once if needed, and we don't want to see either you or the equipment hurt.

When working with glass equipment, take care that you never use too much force opening or closing valves, and keep metal and heavy objects away from the glass parts, we don't want any breakages. When working with pumps, don't expose them directly to atmospheric pressure while they are operating. Only rotary pumps and pumping lines should be filled with air immediately after turning the pump off. Both diffusion pumps and sorption pumps are thermal pumps and should not be exposed to air while they are operating. Even after you have turned off the heat or removed the cooling nitrogen, these pumps take some time to change temperature, so they should be left sealed off from the lab throughout this process. Finally, when handling liquid nitrogen, you must take care not to spill this very cold liquid onto material that will absorb the liquid and hold it in contact with your skin. A small amount spilled on bare skin should not cause a problem, but spilling it onto clothing such as sweaters can lead to burns. Therefore, you should roll up your sleeves if you are working with liquid nitrogen. In summary, we ask you to be careful.  When in doubt, ask your TA or instructor for assistance.

For each experiment, you will make some observations or measurements and record these in your lab notebook. The observations or data that must be recorded in the lab notebook are indicated in {\bf bold type} in the experimental procedures accompanying each experiment.

\section{Introduction}

Mechanical gauges are relatively simple and inexpensive devices used to measure the pressure inside a chamber or gas line. They are equally adept at measuring pressures either above (high pressure) or below (vacuum) atmospheric pressure. Examples of mechanical gauges designed to measure high pressure can be found on the regulator of the helium tank that is used in the "Leaks and Leak Detection" experiment. The "Mechanical Gauges and Pumps" will introduce you to mechanical gauges used to measure pressures in vacuum systems.

Mechanical gauges operate by comparing the pressure inside the vessel to which they are attached, to the pressure outside the gauge, i.e. the pressure in the room in which you are working. Consider a piston with springs attached to each side, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:vac1}. One side of the piston is open to the experimental chamber and the other to the lab room. When the chamber pressure is above room or atmospheric pressure, the gauge reads a positive value. When the room pressure is higher, the piston is pushed to the left, resulting in a negative number. This design has led to the terminology of gauge pressure and absolute pressure. Absolute pressure is the pressure relative to zero force or zero particles. It is the true pressure generated by a gaseous sample. Gauge pressure, on the other hand, is the pressure measured relative to 1 atmosphere. To convert from gauge pressure to absolute pressure, simply add 1 atmosphere to the gauge pressure value.

This type of mechanical device has an interesting effect on pressure measurements. When using a regular mechanical gauge, the value that the gauge reads is dependent on the actual atmospheric pressure. In other words, if a storm front moves through the city that you are working in, the reading on your mechanical pressure gauge will change. 

There are a variety of pressure units in common usage throughout the scientific and industrial communities. Table 1 summarizes some of the commonly used units.

There are two general types of mechanical gauge scales used with vacuum systems.  The first is the one discussed above, where the gauge is measuring gas pressure. In general, a zero reading (atmospheric) is in the middle of the scale. As a chamber is pumped out, the needle wraps counterclockwise indicating more and more negative gauge pressures. Some pressure gauges read "absolute" pressure by labeling the position of the needle when chamber and room pressures are equal at 14.7 psi or 760 Torr. The negative side of the gauge then counts down towards zero pressure. Can you see the problem that this can cause, especially for labs that are not at sea level? The alternate set-up that is often found is a vacuum gauge. This type of gauge measures the amount of "vacuum" that has been generated. At room pressure, the gauge reads zero. Then, as you pump out the chamber, the needle wraps clockwise, indicating that more and more vacuum is being generated. It is somewhat odd terminology, but is still used. This system is designed to allow you to look at both a vacuum gauge and a pressure gauge.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The experimental apparatus for this system is quite simple. It consists of a small hand-operated rotary vacuum pump and a motor-driven pump. The pumps are connected to several mechanical gauges, including both vacuum and pressure gauges. Examine the pump unit to ensure that you are going to turn the handle in the correct direction as indicated by the arrow on the side of the pump. Turn the handle slowly and observe the mechanism through the Plexiglas plate. Do you understand how the pump works?

\item Open the valve to the gauge assembly and use pump air out of the system with the hand-operated pump. Watch the gauge readings as the system is evacuated. How fast does this occur? Are there any differences in the behaviours of the gauges? 

\item Once the pressure has reached a final steady-state value, close the valve to the pump. Examine the values of the gauges. Do the values on the different gauges make sense, both with respect to one another and with respect to the atmospheric pressure? You might want to consult Table 1 for conversions between different units.

\item What is the effect of the fact that Calgary is roughly 1000 m above sea level? Using the mercury barometer located in the lab, record the atmospheric pressure in the laboratory. Ask your TA for help to use this device. {\bf In your lab notebook, record the absolute pressure measured by one of the gauges in the assembly and the relative pressure recorded by on of the gauges in the assembly. Do the gauge pressures and the atmospheric pressure in the laboratory reconcile with each other?}

\item Let air back into the system. Then, try pumping the system at different speeds with the hand-operated pump. What is the effect of the speed on the ultimate pressure that you can achieve?

\item Close the vent valve and evacuate the gauge assembly using the motor-driven rotary vane mechanical pump. {\bf In your lab notebook, record the absolute pressure measured by one of the gauges in the assembly and the relative pressure recorded by on of the gauges in the assembly. How do these pressures compare with those recorded in Step 4?}

\item When you are finished measuring the pressures on the gauges, isolate the rotary vane mechanical pump from the gauge assembly and vent the entire system back to atmospheric pressure.

\section{Introduction}

The vast majority of all techniques that are used to evacuate gases from containers use some form of moving parts to accomplish this feat. In some cases, such as rotary mechanical, turbo molecular, and roots blower pumps, the moving parts are mechanical, generally rotating vanes that push and compress the gases, forcing them out of the vessel. In other cases, such as the Diffstak and glass diffusion pumps it is gets of gas that are directed to push all the atoms and molecules out of the chamber. However, there is one exception to all of these techniques.  These are the cryogenic pumping techniques, which use condensation and absorption of atoms and molecules to remove gas particles from an evacuated chamber. The example that you will meet here is a Sorption Pump. Sorption pumps use liquid nitrogen cooled 'molecular sieve' material to condense and absorb atoms or molecules. Molecular sieve is a chemical that is designed to have a large surface area and a large number of small openings throughout its structure, which are just the correct size to trap selected atoms or molecules.

\end{marginfigure}

The Sorption pump shown in Fig. \ref{fig:vac2} consists simply of a long glass tube with two connectors positioned near the top of the tube. The tube is completely enclosed other then these two opening, to which are generally connected vacuum tubes. The tube is filled with a mixture of molecular sieve and copper strands. The molecular sieve material does the pumping, while the copper is there principally to ensure that the entire system is at a uniform temperature. The top vacuum connection is actually a long tube that goes down the middle of the tube through the pumping material to its opening near the bottom of the tube. The top of the glass tube is removable to allow for addition or replacement of the molecular sieve/copper filament mixture.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item When working with this sorption pump system, the first step is to have everything at air pressure and the vent valve is open. Turn on the vacuum gauge. If everything working properly, the reading on the display should be atmospheric pressure.

\item The next steps involve 'starting' the sorption pump. Close the valve.

\item Due to the hazards of working with liquid nitrogen, and the fragility of the pump glassware, you should get assistance from a staff member or TA for this step. The sorption pump is started by immersing it in liquid nitrogen. A Dewar and laboratory stand are provided, so that the liquid nitrogen can be raised to immerse the sorption pump SLOWLY. Remember, the liquid nitrogen is very cold and care should be taken when it is handled. Consult with a staff member or TA to get tips on working with liquid nitrogen.

\item {\bf Once the sorption pump is immersed, record the gauge pressure in your lab notebook.} Do you think that the residual gas left in the chamber after evacuation with a sorption pump would be 'cleaner' than if an oil rotary mechanical pump were used? What gases do not freeze at the temperature of liquid nitrogen?

\item {\bf Wait approximately 10 minutes and record the ultimate pressure that the sorption pump reaches.}

\item If you have time, you can reverse the procedure to bring the system back to room temperature. Lower the liquid nitrogen bath and discard the remaining liquid nitrogen on the floor (this is a time-honoured method of disposing of this material, discuss with a staff member or TA why this is so).

\item Watch as the pressure begins to rise. The pump will eventually explode if left alone, so you MUST now open the vent valve to let the pump return to room pressure. What happens now is that the air rushes back in and fills the sorption pump with air and moisture.

\item The last step is to 'bake out' the sorption pump to get it ready for another pumping cycle. GENTLY heat the pump with the heat gun provided. Remember, the glass can fracture if it is heated or cooled too suddenly or unevenly, so heat the pump carefully and slowly. Make sure the vent valve is open so that the air and moisture being baked out have somewhere to go.

\item After the pump reaches room temperature close the valve and turn off the vacuum gauge.

\section{Introduction}

One of the major challenges of working with high vacuum systems is assembling a leak free system. In order to reach very low pressure, you must remove or minimize all sources of gas entering the system. Practically speaking there are two types of gas sources. The first is the out-gassing that all physical objects do when pumped down to vacuum pressures. Any object will tend to adsorb gas from its surrounding to a great or lesser extent, and when the gas surrounding the object is removed, the object will gradually give off the gas that it has adsorbed. How much gas is given off, and how long it takes to be given off is very much a function of the object being pumped out. Eventually, surfaces have given off their adsorbed gas and the out-gassing stops or at least is reduced to undetectable amounts.

The other source of gas is actual leaks in the vacuum system. As a vacuum chamber is reduced to lower and lower pressures, the pressure gradient between the inside and the outside of the chamber gets larger and larger. The rate at which gas can leak through a small hole in a chamber wall is dependent both on the size of the hole and on the pressure gradient across the hole. Thus, as the pressure drops, small leaks become more and more important, preventing the system from reaching its lowest possible pressure.

There are a variety of techniques used to look for leaks in a vacuum system. This project will introduce you to some of these methods, including techniques for determining whether or not a leak exists and then trying to find the location of the leak. This exercise provides you with a "leaky" vacuum chamber. The chamber has one or more small leaks, which you can find.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Turn on the rotary pump and open the pump valve to evacuate the system.

\item Monitor the pressure with the vacuum gauge. {\bf In your lab notebook, record how long it takes for the system to reach a steady pressure and how low that pressure is.}

\item Close the pump valve and see whether the pressure remains constant or how quickly it changes. Then reopen the pump valve and re-evacuate the chamber.

\item You will now need to work with a high-pressure helium gas line. {\bf \textit{Find a staff member or TA to assist you before proceeding.}} You first want to remove the air from the helium gas line. Make sure the valve on the tank is closed and then open the "helium valve" to evacuate the gas line. Once the pressure has dropped, close the "helium valve" and open the valves on the helium tank itself. Do not change the valve in front of the gauges on the tank, this valve controls the total pressure, and it should already be correctly set.

\item {\bf \textit{Close the pump valve}} and open the helium valve. This will fill your system with slightly over 1 atmosphere of helium. At this point, any leaks will have helium flowing out of them, instead of air into them.

\item Take the "Leak Detective" helium sniffer unit and turn it on. Use the knob on the front to zero the detector so that only a single green light is lit when its detector is well away from any leaks. Take the hand-held nozzle and hold it beside the apparatus, the lights will probably not change. If you move the nozzle near leaking He, then you should see the red LEDs light up indicating that the sniffer has detected excess helium in the air, which is a leak. When you move the nozzle away from the leak and wait for a few seconds the red lights should go out. 

\item There are at least two leaks in the system. Can you find them? Remember, the leaks are quite small, and you need to move the detector nozzle slowly as the system does have a response time. {\bf In your lab notebook, record the location of the leaks.}

\item Once you have found the leaks, be sure to close the helium valve and the two valves on the helium tank (but not the handle that sets the pressure). You can now turn off the pump and immediately fill the chamber and pump with air. If you fail to vent the system, the residual vacuum will actually suck the oil out of the pump and into the pump lines and chamber, making a horrible mess.

\section{Introduction}

Air pressure decreases as the altitude increases. This fact forms the basis for the operating principles of conventional altimeters found in airplanes. These mechanical devices measure the atmospheric pressure and then mechanically convert this measurement into an altitude. Altimeters measure the height above sea level, not the height above the ground, so even if you have an altimeter, it is necessary to have some knowledge of the geography over which you are flying or skydiving, to avoid unpleasant ground intercept trajectories.

This experimental project is designed to allow you to determine the dependence between an altimeter reading and actual pressure. Using a vacuum pump, you will lower the pressure of a metal manifold, which has assorted vacuum gauges and an altimeter connected to it. At various times you will stop pumping on the manifold and measure the pressure and altimeter reading, gradually building up a plot that will demonstrate the relationship between these two quantities. 

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Examine the vacuum manifold system in front of you and compare it to the schematic shown in Figure \ref{fig:vac4}. Please ensure that you understand the connections and how to pump out the manifold and control which gauges are connected to it. If you are at all unsure, please go over the system with one of the laboratory staff.

\item Open the valve that connects the altimeter and capacitance manometer to the vacuum manifold. Ensure that the manifold is at atmospheric pressure and record the pressure and altitude readings.   

\item Ensure that the vent valve for the mechanical pump is closed and then turn on this rotary vane mechanical pump, which you will be using to evacuate the manifold.  

\item Slowly open the main pumping valve to evacuate some air from the manifold. Close the valve as soon as the pressure has changed significantly. {\bf In your lab notebook, record the pressure and altimeter reading and then repeat the process to further lower the pressure.}  Continue until the pressure and or altimeter reading is no longer changing. (Note: the maximum altitude that you will achieve is in the neighbourhood of 45000 feet due to a protection relay device inside the altimeter.)

\item {\bf Generate a plot of pressure versus altitude reading using your data and include it in your lab notebook.} If you feel that your data is insufficient you can bring the manifold up to atmospheric pressure again (consult the staff about this if you are at all unsure) and then collect more pressure-altitude data as described in Step 4.

\item Take a moment to look at your data and consider what sort of functional dependence the pressure has on the altitude. Does this dependence make sense? If you are twice as high is the pressure half as much? more? less?

\section{Introduction}

A basic vacuum system consists of a pump to generate the vacuum, a hose to connect the vacuum pump to the process chamber, and gaskets to seal the connections. Additionally, one would probably add a vacuum gauge to measure the pressure in the system and a foreline trap to prevent oil vapour produced by the oil-sealed rotary pump from migrating into the vacuum chamber. Vacuum valves may be inserted in the vacuum system to isolate the process chamber from the vacuum pump as well as enabling the system to be brought back up to atmospheric pressure.  

Your goal in this exercise is to assemble a vacuum system, generate a vacuum in the chamber, measure the ultimate pressure, and then bring the system back to atmospheric pressure. Your system should feature:
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
\item a foreline trap,
\item an isolation valve between the vacuum pump and the process chamber,
\item an isolation valve to bring the system back to atmospheric pressure, and
\item a thermocouple gauge to measure the pressure in the system. 
\end{enumerate}
Keep in mind that the presence of water vapour and oils from your fingers will outgas in the vacuum and limit the lowest pressure your system will achieve. Therefore, always handle vacuum components with gloves.

In your design of the vacuum system, keep in mind that corners and narrow diameter vacuum lines will degrade the pumping speed. Keep the number of connections to a minimum as every connector is a potential source of an air leak. The foreline trap should be located as close to the oil-sealed rotary pump as possible.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Draw a schematic diagram of your proposed vacuum system.}  Make sure to label each component.

\item {\bf In point form, describe how you will operate your vacuum system, including the initial start-up, operation, and venting.}  It is important that you consider the order that the isolation valves are open or closed when starting and venting the system.  Remember that vacuum pumps should never be left pumping on air at atmospheric pressure for long periods of time.  This will eventually break down the oil and damage the pump.

\item Assemble the system that you have designed.

\item Following your instructions, start the vacuum pump. {\bf Record the lowest pressure that you are able to generate in the vacuum system.}

\item After a couple of minutes at a stable pressure, bring the system back up the atmospheric pressure.

\item Disassemble the vacuum system, ready for the next group to work with.

\section{Introduction}

The amount of flow in a vacuum can be described by two quantities commonly used in fluid mechanics, {\bf volumetric flow}, and the {\bf throughput}. Volumetric flow, S, is the net volume of gas that passes through a given area in a unit time and is expressed in units of m$^3\times$s$^{-1}$. The throughput, Q, is the number of molecules that pass through a channel in a unit time and is expressed in units of Pa$\times$m$^3\times$s$^{-1}$. Since the number of molecules in a unit volume of gas is directly proportional to the pressure, the throughput can be represented mathematically as

\begin{equation}
Q=PS
\label{equ:vac1}
\end{equation}

Due to the {\bf conservation of mass}, throughput is always {\bf conserved} when dealing with flow through geometries of different sizes. Figure \ref{fig:vac5} shows a channel whose geometry varies in size at some point where A1 is the area of the larger portion of the channel and A2 is the area of the smaller portion. Providing that the temperature of the gas remains unchanged the number of molecules that pass into the smaller chamber remains constant, conserving the throughput even though the volume of the channel changes with length. Therefore, the gas output is equal to the gas input in this portion of the channel and hence

\begin{equation}
Q_1=Q_2=Q
\label{equ:vac2}
\end{equation}

\noindent for the entire length of the channel.

Pumps are designed to remove gas from the system at a constant volumetric flow rate or an {\bf effective pumping speed} of the system. For a given throughput and lowest system pressure required, it is possible to use Equation \ref{equ:vac1} to estimate the pumping speed needed to achieve that pressure.

The throughput of a vacuum system allows for the derivation of the rate in which the pressure will decrease when it is being pumped on. This {\bf pumpdown rate} can be derived by considering the throughput of gas from a chamber into a pump. Figure \ref{fig:vac6} shows a pump that is attached to an enclosed chamber of volume V. Assume that there is a perfect seal between the pump and the chamber so that all of the gas leaving the chamber goes directly into the pump. Since the volume of the chamber remains constant, the throughput of the gas leaving the volume, Q$_V$, changes only due to the varying pressure of the system such that 

\begin{equation}
Q_V=-V\dfrac{dP}{dt}
\label{equ:vac3}
\end{equation}

\noindent The negative sign arises since the pressure in the chamber is decreasing with time.

The throughput on the pump side, Q$_P$, is the amount of gas that is entering the pump and is given by Equation \ref{equ:vac4}. Note that in this case S represents the speed of the pump. Combining Equations \ref{equ:vac1}, \ref{equ:vac2}, and \ref{equ:vac3} results in

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{dP}{dt}+\dfrac{S}{V}P=0
\label{equ:vac4}
\end{equation}

\noindent This is a first order linear differential equation with the exponential solution

\begin{equation}
P(t)=P_0e^{-\frac{S}{V}t}
\label{equ:vac5}
\end{equation}

\noindent where t is the time to pump down to the pressure P, and P$_0$ is the initial pressure of the chamber. From this equation, it can be seen that the pressure of a vacuum system decreases exponentially with time as it is pumped down. Due to the fact that this is an exponential decrease, a plot of pressure versus time for a system pumpdown is often referred to as the {\bf pumpdown curve}. Note that for most vacuum systems S is assumed to remain constant with time. Therefore, since the volume of the chamber does not change, the S/V term in the exponential is a constant that is characteristic of the particular vacuum system, including both the pump and the enclosed volume.

The apparatus used in this experiment can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:vac7}. It consists of a {\bf Bell Jar}, which acts as the process chamber for this vacuum system. The chamber is connected to a pump by means of a long tube. A foreline trap is placed between the pump and the connecting tube.

The base of this system is constructed from a stainless steel plate. The bottom of the bell jar is lined with rubber which creates a seal between the jar and the base. The tube connecting the pump to the chamber is fed through the bottom of the base plate and into the Bell jar. Whenever a piece of glass is placed under vacuum there is a chance that the glass could implode due to the pressure. As a safety precaution, whenever the bell jar is being pumped down below atmospheric pressure always ensure that it is covered with the protective steel shielding.

A {\bf thermocouple gauge} attached to the base of the Bell Jar measures the pressure of the system. A computer equipped with an analog-to-digital converter, instrumentation amplifier, and LoggerPro software records the voltage output of the thermocouple gauge.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Before beginning, ensure that the protective steel caging is placed over the Bell jar. This is absolutely necessary since any piece of glass placed under vacuum has a risk of imploding. If the protective steel caging is not on the Bell jar, consult the TA before continuing.

\item Start the vacuum pump.

\item Start the Loggerpro software on the computer and load the pumpdown\_template.cmbl file located on the desktop. After the file has been loaded a window will appear prompting you to connect the instrumentation amplifier to that computer. Set the instrumentation amplifier to 0-20 mV. Click on the "connect" button located in the lower right corner of the screen, then click ok.

\item Vent the Bell jar by first closing the pump valve and then opening up the vent valve. Leave the vent valve open with the pump valve closed for about 2 minutes to allow the Bell jar time to return to atmospheric pressure.

\item Close the vent valve and then start the data collection in Loggerpro. Once the computer has started collecting data open up the pump valve to allow the system to pump down.

\item Allow the system to pump down for roughly 15 minutes, at which point the system should approximately be at a pressure of 100 millitorr. {\bf At this point measure the pressure of the system using the output on the Loggerpro software and record this as the ultimate pressure of the system.} At any point during the operation of the software the scales on the graphs can be manipulated by moving the mouse cursor over the graph until it turns into a cross and double clicking. Under the Axes Options tab the scales can either be entered manually or set to autoscale. Note that the autoscaling feature will only work while data is being collected. After the data acquisition has ceased the scales will have to be set manually.

\item Stop the data collection in LoggerPro and set the maximum and minimum for pressure on the pumpdown curve to be 2000 millitorr and 0 millitorr respectively. Once this has been done, {\bf fit an exponential to the graph.} To fit an exponential to the pumpdown curve, the appropriate region of the graph should be highlighted with a grey box using the mouse. Note that there are two shades of grey that are used to select the graph. The lighter shade of grey confines only the horizontal region while the darker grey box includes both the horizontal and vertical regions of the selected portion of the graph. After the region has been selected, click the "Curve Fit" button at the top of the screen. Under the list of predefined functions select the combo box with the equation A*exp(-Ct)+B.

\item {\bf Print a copy of the pumpdown curve you determined for the vacuum system.} To print the graph, select the box containing the graph by clicking on the white space outside of the axes to highlight it. After the graph has been selected, go to the File menu and select the "Print Graph" option located near the bottom of the menu.

\item Switch off the vacuum pump and vent the Bell jar.
\end{enumerate}

The Physics Junior Laboratory operates two systems that demonstrate how a high vacuum system may be generated by an oil diffusion pump and a turbo molecular pump. These systems are available for you to explore. Please contact a TA if you would like to have a closer look. High vacuum systems are more complex than the systems you have encountered to this point and can be easily damaged if you are not experienced with their operation.

\section{Introduction}

Diffstak diffusion pumps are among the most common designs for commercial oil diffusion pumps. It is a multistage pump, with the stages stacked one on to of the other in a stack, called a Diffstak. This arrangement is available for you to look at.

Oil diffusion pumps are commonly used to reach medium to high vacuum levels with  $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-7}$ Torr easily achievable, and even lower pressures possible with specially designed systems. Diffusion pumps are probably the most efficient pumping system for removing light atoms such as hydrogen, but it has the disadvantage of generating a "dirtier" vacuum, due to oil back flow, compared to turbo molecular or ion-getter pumps. This effect can be minimized by the addition of a baffled liquid nitrogen trap, which reduces the pumping speed somewhat, but greatly improves the quality of the vacuum by condensing oil vapour that might flow back from the pump to the chamber.

Diffstak diffusion pumps are classified by their inside diameter, with the smallest pumps being as small as 1" diameter. Large pumps, up to 18" in diameter and larger, are commonly available for use with large vacuum systems.  2", 4", and 6" diffusion pumps can be found in the Physics and Astronomy Department. The unit you will be using is a 3" pump.

The purpose of this laboratory is to introduce you to the Diffstak pumps and two types of vacuum gauges (thermocouple and ionization). Thermocouple gauges are useful for measure low quality vacuums. They, like the related Pirani Gauges, work by measuring the change in thermal conductivity in a gas as the pressure changes. With a thermocouple gauge, a current is run through a thermocouple junction positioned inside the vacuum. This heats up the wire, generating a DC potential in the thermocouple. When the pressure falls, less heat is dissipated from the wire, resulting in a higher temperature in the thermocouple, and thus a larger DC potential. The control unit measures the DC potential and converts it into an absolute pressure reading. Thermocouple gauges are accurate from nearly an atmosphere down to roughly 1 mTorr. At lower pressures, an ionization gauge is commonly used to measure pressures.

The ionization gauge operates by generating free electrons from an electrically-heated filament. These electrons collide with atoms in the low-pressure gas, generating ions. A negatively biased collection electrode attracts the positively charge ions but repels the electrons.  The control unit simply counts the number of ions, actually the number of charges, hitting the collection electrode. At low enough pressures the dependence of the electrode current is relatively simple: higher pressure means more atoms and molecules to ionize which yields a larger current. These gauges work from roughly $10^{-3}$ Torr down below $10^{-10}$ Torr. At times contaminants collect in the gauge heads, and at very low pressures these contaminants can lead to erroneously high pressure readings. Therefore, these gauges have a feature known as outgassing, in which a heating filament raises the temperature of the gauge head, in an effort to remove most of the contaminants.

To the frustration of every experimenter, all vacuum systems leak at some rate, however small. In general, the pump overcomes this leak rate. In order to observe a leak rate, one simply isolates the chamber of interest from all vacuum pumps, and observes how rapidly the pressure rises. Alternately, one can then open up the pump valves, and determine how quickly the pressure falls, determining the pumping rate. Figure \ref{fig:vac8} diagrams the experimental apparatus, and labels the valves, defining the terminology used in the following experimental procedure descriptions.

There are two rules that you must follow while working with this system:

\indent {\bf Rule \#1:} never expose an operating diffusion pump to atmospheric pressure.
\indent {\bf Rule \#2:} never have both the roughing valve and the backing valve, or both the roughing and the main valve open at the same time.

\section{Introduction}

Many of us are familiar with thinking about gases as fluids that flow from high-pressure regions to low pressure regions. As one decreases the pressure, gases cease to behave as conventional fluids. At atmospheric pressure (760 Torr), the mean free path of an atom or molecule (average distance it travels between collisions with other atoms or molecules) is only a few tens of microns, and even at 1 Torr the mean free path is only a few mm. However, at $10^{-6}$ Torr, the mean free path has reached 51 m, and the particles travel as projectiles, crossing chambers in straight lines and bouncing off chamber walls rather than other atoms. At these low pressures, the gas no longer flows into regions of lower pressure, so mechanical rotary pumps are ineffective. Instead, one uses a projectile approach to lowering the pressure. For example, if you can hit an atom towards the exhaust of the chamber, one can reduce the atomic density.  This is the basic principle of operation of a turbo molecular pump. It looks very much like a turbojet mounted on the side of your vacuum chambers. It has a series of very fast spinning rotor blades angled so that when they strike atoms they drive them down the turbo-pump, where further blades keep the atoms moving downwards. This device will in fact concentrate the atoms to the point where a conventional rotary pump can removed the compressed gas out of turbo molecular pump. Turbo molecular pumps are always operated in series with rotary pumps.

The demonstration consists of a vacuum chamber, turbo molecular pump, and rotary pump. This system has an ionization gauge to measure the pressure in the vacuum chamber.  Compare the pressure in the chamber pumped by the turbo molecular pump to that measured in the system pumped by the oil diffusion pump. 

Unfortunately, due to the high cost and relatively sensitive nature of these pumps, we cannot let everyone try operating these systems for themselves. In addition, on a high vacuum scale, metal actually looks like a sponge, absorbing and "outgassing" atoms and molecules.  Whenever such a system is exposed to air, the metal surfaces adsorb the atoms and molecules.  It then takes a long time to pump the system to very low pressures since the metal surfaces themselves give off gas for quite a long time period. Therefore, we cannot keep re-opening the vacuum chamber and still achieve very low pressures.

\chapter{Laboratory Safety}

\section{Introduction}
People who survive to reach adulthood generally acquire a mental list of safety rules that are followed to prevent injury to themselves and others. These rules are learned 
from sources such as parents, teachers, and experience. However, the practice of experimental physics can involve the handling of materials, instruments, and processes that
lie outside the realm of common experience. The rules described here must be added to your mental list to handle these new situations. This is part of your education in 
physics. For the safety of yourself and others you are required to read, understand, and follow these guidelines.

All of the physics experiments you will perform have been designed with the safety of the student in mind. This necessarily assumes that all the apparatus is used in a 
reasonable manner. Do not mishandle or abuse the equipment. Use your common sense. Always maintain an awareness of the consequences of your actions for yourself and others.
No food, drink, or smoking is permitted in the laboratory, to reduce the chance that it will be contaminated before being consumed. Also, spilled drinks can be dangerous 
near electrical equipment. Some physics experiments use ice or ice water for cooling. Do not eat or drink the ice or ice water, since it may be contaminated. Never work in a
laboratory alone, there should always be someone else present to get help if necessary. In the event of any accident in the lab, you must notify your instructor immediately.
The following comments describe the hazards you may encounter while in a physics laboratory and the relevant safety procedures to follow.

\section{Heavy Metals}
Lead is used for shielding in radiation experiments. Heavy metals such as lead can be absorbed into your body through the skin and mouth. They accumulate in the brain and 
eventually cause brain damage when a large enough amount is present. The total dosage of lead in the brain builds up over your lifetime as a function of total  accumulated 
exposure. Minimize your exposure to lead in the laboratory by handling it as little as possible. Do not touch any food or your face while working with lead. Wash your hands
after handling lead objects. Lead is also very dense. Be aware of this when moving blocks of lead and do not drop them.

Observe the same precautions when doing an experiment that uses mercury. As with lead, mercury can also be absorbed into the body to accumulate over your lifetime. Mercury 
has the added properties that it is a liquid which can be spilled and any open container of liquid mercury produces mercury vapour which can be inhaled. Avoid spilling 
mercury and try to keep it in a sealed container if possible. Make sure there is a spill tray underneath any experiment that involves the use of mercury. If mercury does get
spilled, notify your instructor so that it can be cleaned up. 

\section{Radiation}
The total dose of radiation you receive depends on the source intensity, the time you are exposed, and your distance from the source. For x-rays and gamma-rays the source 
intensity drops as the inverse square of the distance. For alpha and beta particles the drop is even faster. Minimize the time that a radioactive source is near you. Keep 
radioactive sources  as far away from you as you reasonably can, consistent with doing the experiment. There are strict regulations about the storage and handling of 
radioactive sources. Do not open, drop or lose them.

\section{Lasers}
Lasers are sources of concentrated parallel beams of monochromatic light, which can quite easily be focussed to tiny spots where the power density is high enough to cause 
damage. Never look into a laser beam, or let it shine into your eye, since you may suffer retinal damage if the laser power is high enough. Reflections from polished 
surfaces are almost as dangerous as the direct beam. Never shine a laser into someone elseâs eyes. Resist the temptation to shine the laser around the room or into the 
hallway. If this is done a person could accidentally gaze into the beam.

\section{Rotating Machinery}
Some experiments use pumps, motors, or other moving mechanisms. Keep fingers and other appendages away from such devices. Be especially careful about long hair and 
loose clothing.

\section{Electricity}
Always wire together your circuits with the power off. Make sure the circuit power is off when changing or moving components around. If you must work on live 
circuits only touch the insulated portions and make sure one hand is in your pocket or behind your back. This eliminates the possibility of current flow through the heart 
and lungs, which can be fatal. Do not touch live exposed connections under any circumstances. Beware of loose wires which can fall off or make unintentional connections, 
usually with undesirable results. Be especially vigilant around high voltage circuits. If the voltage is high enough, it is not necessary to touch the circuit to get a 
shock, since sparks can jump across a gap of air. Capacitors require particular care since they can store charge internally for hours after being disconnected from a 
circuit. Make sure capacitors are discharged before touching the terminals. When using spark timers on the air tracks make sure the hands of all your lab partners are clear
before starting the spark source.

\section{Cryogenic Materials}
Some physics experiments involve the use of liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, dry ice, or an organic solvent cooled with dry ice. These materials are cold. Do not touch them 
with your hands. Wear protective gloves when handling a container containing a cryogenic material. Do not splash or spill these cold liquids. Be careful not to touch parts 
that have been in contact with a cryogenic material, they will be cold as well. If a spill does happen, notify your instructor but do not touch the spill, it will evaporate
naturally. There must always be a way for evaporated cryogenic liquid to escape from a vessel, otherwise a dangerous build-up of pressure will occur.

\section{Pressure and vacuum vessels}
Gas bottles are under high pressure. If they are breached they will explode with the force of a bomb. Never jar or mishandle a pressure vessel when it is pressurized. 
Vacuum systems will implode when breached. Do not jar or abuse them either. Always bring the vacuum (or pressure) back to normal slowly. Before adjusting any valves make 
sure you understand the purpose of each valve and the consequences of operating it. Turn it slowly at first so you can change your mind if something seems to be wrong.

\section{Microwaves}
People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting electro-metallic implants should refrain from doing physics experiments that involve microwaves.

\section{Strong Magnetic Fields}
Strong magnetic fields will erase your credit cards, computer disks, and audio tapes. They will also damage watches, tape players, and other electronic devices. Do not leave
any such objects near a strong magnet or electromagnet. Check the area around an electromagnet before turning it on. People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting
electro-metallic implants should also refrain from doing physics experiments that involve powerful magnetic fields. Anything containing a magnet, or magnetic material like 
iron, steel, nickel, or cobalt, should also be kept away from strong magnetic fields. They may be damaged or pulled into the region of the field with enough force to break 
something.

\section{Stroboscopes}
Some people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or severe migraine headaches if they view strobe lights flashing at a frequency of 5 to 25 Hz. Refrain from doing an 
experiment involving strobe lights if you know you are susceptible. Notify the instructor immediately if you see someone adversely affected by an operating stroboscope.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

To predict and observe the workings of an Atwood Machine. To explore the concepts of acceleration and Newton's laws. To observe the behaviour of systems. To learn how experimental results can be used to test a physical theory.

\section{Theory}

An {\bf Atwood machine} is a device that was created by George Atwood in 1784. This device is detailed in his work "A Treatise on the Rectilinear Motion and the Rotation of Bodies" published that same year. Atwood was a popular lecturer 
at Trinity College Cambridge due in part to the widespread use of demonstrations in his sessions. Atwood used his device to illustrate the laws of uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity.

\caption{Ideal Atwood Machine}
\label{fig:iaIdealAtwoodsMachine}
\end{marginfigure}

An Atwood machine consists of two weights, a string, and a pulley like that shown in Figure \ref{fig:iaIdealAtwoodsMachine}. In an {\bf ideal Atwood machine}, the two masses are attached to a perfectly flexible, massless string that passes over a frictionless and 
massless pulley. 

The free-body diagrams for an Atwood machine are shown in Figure \ref{fig:iaFreeBodyDiagram}. Here, T is the tension in the string, the masses are m$_{1}$ and m$_{2}$, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The unequal gravitational forces acting on the 2 masses 
accelerate them.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Free body digaram of an Atwood Machine}
\label{fig:iaFreeBodyDiagram}
\end{marginfigure}

Consider the system qualitatively. The mass m$_{1}$ experiences only two forces, T, the tension in the string and its weight, m$_{1}$g. The net force then is the difference between the two. The net force on m$_{2}$ is also the difference 
between T and its weight. If m$_{2}$ is the lighter mass, it is expected that m$_{2}$g < T. Similarly if m$_{1}$ is the larger mass then the weight, m$_{1}$g, is greater than T. The heavier mass is predicted to tend downwards. The lighter 
mass is anticipated to move upwards. The string is essentially inextensible, so the forces acting on the bodies are transmitted through the string to act on the objects directly causing them to move at the same speed.

As there are two bodies and two diagrams, there must also be two expressions to describe the motion of the system. These can then be solved to get an expression for the acceleration. Using these observations, and Newton's laws, 
the equations are

\begin{equation}
\sum{F_{1}}=m_{1}a=m_{1}g-T,
\label{equ:iaAcceleration1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sum{F_{2}}=m_{2}a=T-m_{2}g,
\label{equ:iaAcceleration2}
\end{equation}

where a is the acceleration of each mass. These equations can be solved for the acceleration,

\begin{equation}
a=\left(\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\right)g.
\label{equ:iaTotalAcceleration}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:iaTotalAcceleration} suggests the acceleration is expected to be a {\bf constant} depending only on the masses used and gravity.

In this experiment an {\bf inclined Atwood machine} as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:iaInclinedAtwoodsMachine} is used. Here one of the masses is placed on an inclined plane instead of hanging freely. To analyze this arrangement, 
Equations \ref{equ:iaAcceleration1} and \ref{equ:iaAcceleration2} must be altered. Only a portion of the weight of the mass on the incline, m$_{2,}$ is applied to the system. The portion of m$_{2}$ that is applied depends on the angle, $\theta$, in Figure \ref{fig:iaInclinedAtwoodsMachine}. The applied weight, W$_{p}$, is

\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
W_{p}=m_{2}gsin\theta=m_{2}g\frac{H}{L},
\label{equ:iaAppliedWeight}
\end{equation}

where H is the rise and L is the length of the inclined surface. This is the component of the weight of m$_{2}$ that is pulled by the string, as such only this reduced force contributes to the tension in the string, T. Both H and L can 
be measured directly so Equation \ref{equ:iaAppliedWeight} expresses the sine of the angle $\theta$, as H/L. This eliminates the need to measure the angle. Also, Equation 4 demonstrates the fact that for a fixed L and a given mass m$_{2}$, 
H controls the magnitude of W$_{p}$. Another alteration must be made due to the presence of friction. Let $\mathnormal{f}$ be the friction in the pulley and $\mathnormal{f^{\prime}}$ be the friction that arises from m$_{2}$ moving on the
surface of the inclined plane. Then for an inclined Atwood machine, Equations \ref{equ:iaAcceleration1} and \ref{equ:iaAcceleration2} become

\begin{equation}
\sum{F_{1}}=m_{1}a=m_{1}g-T-f,
\label{equ:iaAcceleration3}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sum{F_{2}}=m_{2}a=T-W_{p}-f-f^{\prime}.
\label{equ:iaAcceleration4}
\end{equation}

Combining Equations \ref{equ:iaAcceleration3} and \ref{equ:iaAcceleration4} allows the acceleration to be found for an inclined Atwood machine. The end result is that the acceleration is expected to be

\begin{equation}
a=\frac{g\left(m_{1}-m_{2}\frac{H}{L}\right)-f_{T}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}.
\label{equ:iaTotalAcceleration2}
\end{equation}

Here $\mathnormal{f_{T}}$ is the sum of all the friction terms that appear in the Equations \ref{equ:iaAcceleration3} and \ref{equ:iaAcceleration4}. Thus if Equation \ref{equ:iaTotalAcceleration2} holds, this system is undergoing uniform 
acceleration. Note that the direction of the acceleration differs depending on which mass is being considered. Therefore Equation \ref{equ:iaTotalAcceleration2} only provides the magnitude of the acceleration.

The acceleration is altered by varying the angle of the incline. The angle of the incline in turn is altered by changing H. Therefore it should be possible to adjust H so that the acceleration equals zero. At such a point the 
system is in {\bf static equilibrium}. This implies that the system is at rest and experiences zero acceleration because the sum of all forces acting on it is zero.

For zero acceleration, Equation \ref{equ:iaTotalAcceleration2} becomes

\begin{equation}
m_{1}=m_{2}\frac{H}{L}+\frac{f_{T}}{g}
\label{equ:iaZeroAcceleration}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:iaZeroAcceleration} gives a linear relationship between the masses and the sine of the angle of inclination as expressed by H/L. This formula helps in making predictions about how the inclined Atwood machine works when 
it is in static equilibrium. This equation also furnishes an indirect method of determining the mass of m$_{2}$.

The actual relationship between the masses and H/L at static equilibrium can be measured and compared with the theoretical prediction given by Equation \ref{equ:iaZeroAcceleration}. The inclined Atwood machine used in this experiment 
consists of a tilted air track with an attached pulley and a hanging weight. The laboratory arrangement is shown in Figure \ref{fig:iaAirTrack}.

\label{fig:iaAirTrack}
\end{figure}

One of the advantages furnished by this arrangement is the reduction of friction. The air track, which is essentially a length of square aluminum tubing that has been drilled with small holes at regular intervals, allows the glider to float in a nearly frictionless environment just above the track. This is accomplished by attaching an {\bf air blower} to the air track, which forces air out of the holes. Friction is difficult to measure, so reducing it has the benefit of 
increased predictability and accuracy in an experiment. A second advantage is that a given mass difference yields a greatly reduced acceleration at small tilt angles. This is due to the difference between the weight of m$_{2}$ versus the 
diminished force W$_{p}$. The resulting lower speeds permit taking data for a longer period of time. As a consequence, the resolution of the experiment is improved. Lastly, the laboratory jack allows the angle between the air track and 
the lab bench to be easily altered. This gives a precise method of altering the force W$_{p}$.

\section{Experimental Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Check that the air blower unit is set maximum

\item L must be determined. This can be done accurately by choosing two reference points on the ruled lines of the air track. L is the separation of these points. It is recommended that L, including its reference points, remain fixed for 
the duration of the experiment. Record the value of L on the accompanying worksheet.

\item The system is at static equilibrium when the hanging mass m$_{1}$ is sufficient to exactly balance the glider (mass m$_{2}$). The procedure is to find a particular balancing mass m$_{1}$ for a given inclination H.

\item The height at each end of the interval L must be measured to find H. Let H$_{1}$ be the height at the higher end of the track and H$_{2}$ be the height at the lower end. H then is defined as the difference between these. As H 
decreases, the weight placed on the hanger must be reduced in order to achieve the next static equilibrium point. The rubber bands provided are useful for masses that require finer divisions than the one gram resolution provided by the 
hanger weights.

\item Repeat step 4 for at least eight measurements of H and the corresponding values of m$_{1}$. Record the values of H$_{1}$, H$_{2}$, H, H/L and m$_{1}$ in a table. Be sure to include errors where appropriate.

\item For comparison, weigh the glider mass m$_{2}$ on the digital balance.

\item Lastly, using the Logger Pro software, and the Vernier Motion Detector, design and implement an experiment in order to check that the acceleration experienced by the glider on the air track is constant. Choose one angle of inclination 
between 0.5 and 5 degrees.

\item Consider the apparatus shown in Figure \ref {fig:iaSwingingAtwood}. It is called a swinging Atwood machine. Both masses are free to move in the plane. When the small weight is dropped what is the outcome? Does the larger mass 
fall to the floor? Implement the system using a length of string, two suitable weights, and an appropriate pivot point. Record your observations.

\end{marginfigure}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Error Analysis}

One of the errors in this experiment is due to the problem of lining up the meter stick and the scale markings on the air track with identical points every time a measurement is made. This error is increased by the fact that the scale is recessed from the edge of the air track, as well as the fact that it is sometimes difficult to place the meter stick exactly perpendicular to the laboratory bench. For these reasons it is recommended that the value of L be at least 1 m, as larger lengths help minimize the error in all measurements. An error in L of $\pm$ 1 mm is suggested by the apparatus. Similar arguments as those used for L above also contribute to the error in H. Unlike L, when measuring H the meter stick moves freely and thus has a greater error present in it. Additional to the measurement uncertainty in H there is an experimental uncertainty that arises due to the static friction between the cart and the track where the cart will remain motionless for a range of heights. Therefore it is suggested that all measurements of H are accurate within $\pm$ 4 mm.\\
Recall that
\begin{equation}
u(f)=\sqrt{\left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|^{2}u(x)^{2}+\left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right|^{2}u(y)^2}.
\label{equ:iaGeneralError}
\end{equation}
where f=f(x,y) and u(f) is the uncertainty in f. By applying this formula it can be shown that since,
\begin{equation}
 sin(\theta)=\frac{H}{L},
\label{equ:iaAngle}
\end{equation} 
that the uncertainty in sin($\theta$) is,

\begin{equation}
u[sin(\theta)]=u\left(\frac{H}{L}\right)=\sqrt{\left| \frac{H}{L^{2}}\right|^{2}u(L)^2+ \left| \frac{1}{L}\right|^{2}u(H)^2}.
\end{equation}


Another consideration for H is that as the angle of inclination is decreased it becomes more difficult to balance the glider's mass because m$_{1}$ becomes quite small. Small masses can be hard to produce with the hanger weights, 
especially since the hanger itself weighs 2 grams. It is possible to use masses below two grams by dispensing with the weight hanger. However, at this point other systematic errors in the experiment will begin to dominate. For this 
reason H values of less than 0.5 cm are best avoided.

There are several systematic errors inherent in the apparatus used here. One limitation is the difficulty in predicting the friction. Possible sources of friction include the pulley, the air track, and the air itself. If the string slips 
on the pulley a different coefficient of friction is applied than if the string rides on the pulley. Also, the moment of inertia of the pulley affects the system. Another force acting on the glider is drag as it passes through the air. 
Lastly the string is neither massless, nor inextensible. It can be noted that the string sags too. This causes the tension force to be reduced, which means that the entire weight force of m 1 is not transferred between the bodies.
These different forces all reduce the precision and accuracy of the experiment.

\section{{\bf To be handed in to the laboratory instructor}}

\section{Prelab Exercises}

\section{{\bf Goals of the Experiment}}

%This lab will investigate the resistive drag force acting on a sphere falling through a cylinder of glycerine using two common models.
To develop the model of the motion an object experiencing free fall in a vacuum into a more intricate model that can be applied to more real world system. To investigate the effects of resistive forces and buoyant forces on a falling object.

\section{{\bf Theory}}

\subsection{Introduction}
The simplest model for describing the motion of an object in free fall is produced by applying Newton's Second Law to an object falling in a vacuum. In this case, the external force acting on the object is constant and the integration of Newton's $2^{nd}$ Law is easily performed. The problem is that most of the real world does not happen in a vacuum, and as a result the simple model for an object in free fall is insufficient. In this lab, the simple model will be expanded to include a few of the major assumptions made with regards to the falling object, as well as the medium the object is falling in. Specifically a model for a falling object will be derived that deals with the density of the object, density of the medium,  buoyancy force, and viscosity of the fluid. This new model will also acknowledge the effect of the shape and smoothness of the object.

\subsection{Background Information}
Fluids have many different properties including {\bf viscosity}.
Viscosity, denoted by $\eta$, is a measure of a fluid's resistance to forces that cause it to change shape or move. For example, honey is more viscous than water. In general, the more viscous the fluid the more difficult it is for the fluid to flow freely. The physical SI unit of viscosity is the Poiseuille (Pl), where $1$ Pl =  Pa $\cdot$ s = $kg/m\cdot s$.% The conversions are as follows,
%\begin{align}
% 1Pl=1Pa\cdot{ s}\\
% 1\mathrm{Pl}&=1\mathrm{Pa\cdot s}\nonumber\\
% 1\mathrm{P}&=100\mathrm{cP}\nonumber\\
% &=0.1\mathrm{Pl}\nonumber\\
% &=0.1\mathrm{Pa\cdot s}.\nonumber
% \end{align}

Another property of liquids as well as other forms of matter is {\bf density}.
The density of any material be it solid or liquid is it's mass per unit volume or mathematically,
\begin{equation}
 \rho=\frac{m}{V}\ ,
 \label{eqn:dfDensity}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the average density of the material making up the object with volume, $V$, and total mass, $m$.

\subsection{Falling Motion in a Fluid}
The motion of an object undergoing gravitational free fall in a vacuum is found from by applying Newton's Second Law to this simple system. For this case the net force on the system is
\begin{equation}
%\vec{F}_{net}=\vec{F}_{g}=-mg\hat{x},
\vec{F}_{net}=m\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\vec{F}_{g}=mg\hat{y},
\label{equ:dfFreeFall}
\end{equation}
where $v$ is the velocity of the falling object, $F_{g}$ is the force of gravity acting on the object, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($g=9.81\ m/s^2$).

A new model for a falling object in a fluid will consider two additional forces which act on the object. Namely it will take into account the buoyancy force, $\vec{F}_{b}$, and the drag force, $\vec{F}_{d}$, acting on the falling object. Newton's Second Law is now written as,
\begin{equation}
m\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\vec{F}_{g}+\vec{F}_{b}+\vec{F}_{d}.
\label{equ:dfNewtonsSecondLawVec}
\end{equation}

  \label{fig:dfFreeBodyDiagram}
\end{marginfigure}Another The viscosity of glycerine is dependent on

The drag force always opposes the direction of motion and the buoyancy force always opposes gravity. If all the motion and forces are one-dimensional then Equation \ref{equ:dfNewtonsSecondLawVec} can be written in the form,
\begin{equation}
m\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}=F_{g}-F_{b}-F_{d}.
\label{equ:dfNewtonsSecondLaw}
\end{equation}
See Figure \ref{fig:dfFreeBodyDiagram} for the sign convention used. 

Every object that is placed in a liquid will experience a {\bf buoyancy} force. The buoyancy force is governed by the Archimedes' Principle which states that "any object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object." For a totally submerged sphere, the volume of liquid displaced is equal to volume of the submerged object. The magnitude buoyancy force is
\begin{equation}
 |F_b|=V_{s}\rho_f g,
 \label{equ:dfBuoyancy}
\end{equation}
where $V_{s}$ is the volume of the falling object, in this case a sphere, and $\rho_f$ is the density of the fluid.

By substituting Equations \ref{equ:dfFreeFall} and \ref{equ:dfBuoyancy} into Equation \ref{equ:dfNewtonsSecondLaw} Newton's second law can now be written as,
\begin{equation}
m\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{dt}}=mg-V_{s}\rho_{f}g-F_{d}.
\end{equation}
 
An object falling in a fluid, or a non-vacuum, will eventually reach a point where the drag and buoyancy forces acting up on the object will balance the gravitational force acting down. Thus the sum of all {\bf external} forces equal zero, and by Newton's first law the velocity must be constant, this is called the {\bf terminal velocity}, $v_{T}$. A constant velocity means that,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}v}{\mathrm{d}t}=0.
\label{equ:dfZeroAcceleration}
\end{equation}

If the object is falling at a terminal velocity the left hand side of Equation \ref{equ:dfNewtonsSecondLaw} can be set equal to zero, and rearranged to produce an expression for the drag force. The drag force at terminal velocity is,
\begin{equation}
F_{d}(v_{T})=mg-V_{s}\rho_f g,
\label{equ:dfDragForce}
\end{equation}
where $F_{d}(v_{T})$ is now a function of terminal velocity.

This result can be further simplified by noting that the mass of the object can also be expressed as $m=V_{s}\rho_{s}$, where $\rho_{s}$ is the density of the sphere. The drag force at terminal velocity is now,
\begin{equation}
F_{d}(v_{T})=V_{s}g(\rho_{s}-\rho_{f})=V_{s}g\Delta\rho.
\label{equ:dfDragForceSimplified}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\rho=\rho_{s}-\rho_{f}$

\subsection{The Drag Force}

Resistive drag forces are present everywhere, whether it is a car driving down the highway, a baseball flying through the air, or bacteria swimming in a puddle. There are two common models that describe the force of drag of an object falling in a medium. 

\begin{marginfigure}
	\center
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{/usr/local/master/labs/physics341-FA2016/Drag-Forces/Turbulent.jpg}
   \caption{A graphical representation of turbulent flow for a sphere with a constant velocity falling through a fluid. Graphic taken from http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-engineering/fluid-dynamics/flow-regime/ on August 31, 2016.}
   \label{fig:dfTurbulent}
\end{marginfigure}

The first model is call {\bf turbulent flow}, and is dependent on the square of the velocity. A graphical representation of turbulent flow of a liquid around a sphere can be seen in figure \ref{fig:dfTurbulent}. Under turbulent flow the drag force is expressed as
\begin{equation}
F_d=\frac{1}{2}\rho_{f}C_{d}Av_{T}^2,
\label{equ:dfTurbulentDragForce}
\end{equation}
where $C_d$ is an empirically measured {\bf drag coefficient} and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the object perpendicular to the direction of motion.

The second model leads to {\bf Stokes Law} for {\bf laminar flow} after the Irish-born mathematician, George Gabriel Stokes ($1819-1903$) who spent most of his professional life describing fluid properties. Stokes' Law is a model for the drag force acting on spheres that depends linearly on the velocity of the sphere through a viscous fluid. A pictorial representation of laminar flow of a liquid around a sphere can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:dfLaminar}. Stokes's Law is,
\begin{equation}
F_{d}=3\pi\eta v_{T}d,
\label{equ:dfStokesLaw}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the viscosity of the medium and d is the diameter of the falling sphere. Note that Stokes' Law is only valid for spherical objects. Equations \ref{equ:dfTurbulentDragForce} and \ref{equ:dfStokesLaw} can be individually substituted into Equation \ref{equ:dfDragForceSimplified}, and rearranged to obtain two possible expressions  $v_{T}$. From the turbulent flow model,

\begin{marginfigure}
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{/usr/local/master/labs/physics341-FA2016/Drag-Forces/Laminar.jpg}
	\caption{A graphical representation of laminar flow for a sphere with a constant velocity falling through a fluid. Graphic taken from http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-engineering/fluid-dynamics/flow-regime/ on August 31, 2016.}
   \label{fig:dfLaminar}
\end{marginfigure}


\begin{equation}
v_{T}=\left[\frac{4gd}{3C_d}\left(\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_f}\right)\right]^{\frac{1}{2}},
\label{equ:dfTurbulantVT}
\end{equation}
and from the Stokes' Law model,
\begin{equation}
v_T=\frac{gd^{2}}{18\eta}\Delta\rho.
 \label{equ:dfLaminarVT}
\end{equation}

%The two extreme cases in which fluids can flow around objects, like spheres are called laminar and turbulent flow. In the case of laminar flow, adjacent fluid particle lines merely flow around the object and return to their previous positions "shearing" along the side of the object.
%This is depicted on the left side of Figure \ref{fig:laminar_turbulent}.
%For turbulent flow the object is usually travelling much faster which creates vortices "behind" it as shown in Figure \ref{fig:laminar_turbulent}.
%This creates a low pressure behind the object and a high pressure under the object adding to the drag force.

\subsection{Corrections to the Model}
One assumption made by Stokes' Law is that the sphere is moving through an infinite or unbound fluid. The reason for this assumption is due to the fact that objects falling near to boundaries fall slower than if they were in an unbound fluid. Since it is impossible to fully satisfy this condition, a velocity correction has been empirically determined for a sphere falling in the center of a fluid filled cylinder. This correction is given as,
\footnote{"Conceptual study of an absolute falling-ball viscometer", Metrologia, 2001, 38 (531-534).} 
\begin{equation}
 v_{corr}=\frac{v_{meas}}{1-2.104\left(\frac{d}{D}\right)+2.09\left(\frac{d}{D}\right)^3-0.95\left(\frac{d}{D}\right)^5}
 \label{eqn:dfCorrection}
\end{equation}
where $v_{corr}$ is the expected velocity of the sphere if it were falling in an unbound fluid, $v_{meas}$ is the experimentally measured mean velocity, $D$ is the diameter of the cylinder and $d$ is the diameter of the sphere.

The literature value for the viscosity of glycerine greatly depends on the temperature and concentration of the glycerine solution. The relationship between viscosity, temperature and concentration is determined using empirical data which is beyond the scope of this experiment. Therefore, for the purposes of this experiment the accepted value for the viscosity of glycerine at standard ambient temperature and pressure for a $99\%$ glycerine and $1\%$ water solution can be taken as 0.767 $Ns/m^2$.    
\footnote{This number was determined using an online calculator at http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/ $\sim$sws04cdw/viscosity\_calc.html which is based on the parameterisation in article {\bf Formula for the Viscosity of a Gycerol-Water Mixture} written by Nian-Sheng Cheng (2008).}

\subsection{Data Analysis}
This experiment will measure the terminal velocity of several spheres of similar material falling in glycerine. The measured terminal velocities will be analysed to determine if the system is best described by turbulent flow, or by laminar flow. Notice that both expression for the terminal velocity, Equations \ref{equ:dfTurbulantVT} and \ref{equ:dfLaminarVT} are of the form
\begin{equation}
v_{T}=Kd^{n},
\label{equ:dfGerneralForm}
\end{equation}
where K is some constant, and the diameter is raised to the power of n. The next step of the analysis process is to take the log of both sides of Equations \ref{equ:dfTurbulantVT} and \ref{equ:dfLaminarVT}.

For the turbulent model 
\begin{equation}
ln(v_{T})=\frac{1}{2}ln(d)+\frac{1}{2}ln(K)\ ,
\label{equ:dfLogOfTurbulant}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
K=\frac{4g}{3C_{d}}\left(\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho}\right).
\label{equ:dfK}
\end{equation}
For the laminar model
\begin{equation}
lnd(v_{T})=2ln(d)+ln(K')\ ,
\label{equ:dfLogOfLaminar}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
K'=\frac{g\Delta\rho}{18\eta}.
\label{equ:dfKPrime}
\end{equation}
Equations \ref{equ:dfLogOfTurbulant} and \ref{equ:dfLogOfLaminar} now present a simply way of comparing the turbulent model with laminar model.
Both equations are linear equations of the form $y=mx+b$ so by plotting $\ln(v_T)$ vs $\ln(d)$ the slope of the graph will determine the power, $n$ appearing in Equation \ref{equ:dfGerneralForm}.

\section{{\bf Experimental Procedure}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item As a class use the digital scale, pipette and petri dish in order to determine the density of glycerine.
\item Use the thermometer to record the temperature of the glycerine liquid within the acrylic column.
\item Measure the diameter, $d$, the mass, $m$ of at least 8 different types of spheres. It is acceptable to assume that all of the spheres of a specific type have the same diameter and mass.
\item Measure the inner diameter, $D$ of the column of glycerine.
\item Choose a start and finish point along the height of the column and measure the distance between them. Record the time it takes for every sphere to fall between the aforementioned start and finish points. Be sure to record at least 10 measurements for every sphere size. {\bf Note} that the spheres should be left in bottom of tube until all of the measurements have been taken. 
\item In order to further justify the need for the correction factor given in Equation \ref{eqn:dfCorrection}, take any two spheres of the same size and drop them at the same time into the column of glycerine with one in the center and one close to the wall. Record any observations relating to how the spheres fall.
\item Once the data acquisition has finished pull the basket up, rinse the spheres in sink and return the spheres to their original container for the next section to use.
\end{enumerate}

\section{{\bf Uncertainty}}

The uncertainty in the terminal velocity can be calculated in two way. The first method is to estimated the error in each measurement, and then propagate those uncertainties through to the final calculation for the terminal velocity. The second way is to take a statistical approach. Take the same measurement several times, and the calculate the average velocity and the standard deviation, $\sigma$, in the measurements. 
\begin{equation}
\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i}-\mu)^2}
\label{equ:dfStandardDiv}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the total number of measurements made, $x_{i}$ is the value if the $i^{th}$ measurement, and $\mu$ is the average value. In this experiment the uncertainty in the measurement of terminal velocity will be calculated in both was, and a choice will need to be made as to which is the more appropriate method to use.
\\

When calculating a terminal velocity that corrects for the presence the tube wall it is acceptable to use the uncertainty for the uncorrected terminal velocity. While proper uncertainty propagation methods could be used to determine a new uncertainty for the corrected velocity, the befits do not out way the amount of work required. 
\\

It is important to note that the viscosity of glycerine has a significant dependence on temperature.

\section{Preparation}

Review the properties of hyperbolic functions.

\section{Goals of the Experiment}

To investigate the behaviour of a flexible chain when suspended by its endpoints. To use
hyperbolic functions in a practical context.

\section{Theory}

If a chain of uniform mass density is suspended by its endpoints, what is the shape the hanging chain forms? Can this shape be described by a mathematical equation? In 1638, Galileo Galilei proposed that a hanging chain can be described 
by a parabola, but did not conclusively demonstrate this. The question of what shape a hanging chain takes remained unsolved for a number of years. It was not until 1691 that Christiaan Huygens, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Johan Bernoulli 
determined the answer to the question. They determined the shape of a hanging chain is a {\bf hyperbolic cosine} function. The name of this shape is the {\bf catenary}, from the Latin word catena for chain. The catenary has many testable 
properties  which can be investigated.

When solving problems involving a chain supporting a mass, it is common to treat the chain as massless. This is valid provided the mass the chain supports is much greater than the mass of the chain itself. For a chain supporting no mass 
other than its own, the chain cannot be considered massless.

Figure \ref{fig:hcSuspendedUniforChain} shows a uniform chain suspended at {\bf A} and {\bf B}. This chain has a total length, $l$, total mass, $m$, and weight per unit length $\omega = mg/l$. Point {\bf C} is the lowest point of the chain, and point {\bf D} is any arbitrary point on the chain. Let $s$ denote the length of chain between C and the arbitrary point D. This is the {\bf arc length} between C and D of the function that describes the suspended chain. It is common when discussing graphs of functions to speak of arc length. Given a function and its graph, it is possible to compute the arc length between two points, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ on the graph. The arc length of a function $y(x)$ is the distance traversed when moving along the graph from a point $(x_{1} ,y(x_{1}))$ to a point $(x_{2} ,y(x_{2}))$.

The tension $T$, at any point along the chain is tangential to the chain. The chain is in static equilibrium, so the sum of forces at any point along the chain must be zero. Therefore, at an arbitrary point, D, on the chain, there are two 
tension vectors of equal magnitude and opposite direction. This tension force can be resolved into a horizontal and vertical component. Let $T_{H}$ denote the {\bf horizontal component} of the tension and $W$ the vertical component. In fact, $W$ is the weight of chain between the lowest point on the chain and the point in question. Figure \ref{fig:hcSumOrVectors} shows the sum of the tension vectors at a point along the chain, with one of the tension vectors being resolved into horizontal and vertical components.

The equations describing the static equilibrium of the segment CD are 

\begin{equation}
Tcos(\theta)=T_{H},
\label{equ:hcEquilibrium1}
\end{equation}
and

\begin{equation}
Tsin(\theta)=W=\omega s.
\label{equ:hcEquilibrium2}
\end{equation}

The slope of the chain at point D can be found in two ways. The first is by taking ratio of the y and x components of the tension. This gives the result

\begin{equation}
tan(\theta)=\frac{W}{T_{H}}=\frac{\omega s}{T_{H}}.
\label{equ:hcSlopeAtD1}
\end{equation}
By rearranging Equation \ref{equ:hcSlopeAtD1} the length of chain between points C and D can be expressed as 

\begin{equation}
s=ktan(\theta),
\label{equ:hcChainConstant1}
\end{equation}
where k is the chain constant and is defined by

\begin{equation}
k=\frac{T_{H}}{\omega}.
\label{equ:hcChainConstant2}
\end{equation}

The slope of the chain at point D can also be described as

\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx}=tan(\theta),
\label{equ:hcSlopeAtD2}
\end{equation}
and from Equations \ref{equ:hcSlopeAtD1} and \ref{equ:hcSlopeAtD2} it follows that,

\begin{equation}
tan(\theta)=\frac{s}{k}=\frac{dy}{dx}.
\label{equ:hcTan1}
\end{equation}
Differentiating Equation \ref{equ:hcTan1} with respect to $x$ leads to

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=\frac{1}{k}\frac{ds}{dx}.
\label{equ:hcSecondOrderDiff1}
\end{equation}

An infinitesimal element of chain, $ds$, obeys the relation 

\begin{equation}
ds=\sqrt{dx^{2}+dy^{2}}.
\label{equ:hcLineSegment}
\end{equation}
Therefore

\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=\frac{1}{k}\frac{ds}{dx}=\frac{1}{k}\frac{\sqrt{dx^{2}+dy^{2}}}{dx}=\frac{1}{k}\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}}.
\label{equ:hcSecondOrderDiff2}
\end{equation}

This is a second order differential equation which describes the behaviour of a hanging chain. The solution of this equation is a function that describes the shape of the chain. A standard method of solving this equation is to reduce the 
order by making the substitution $p=dy/dx$.

\begin{equation}
\frac{dp}{dx}=\frac{1}{k}\sqrt{1+p^{2}}.
\label{equ:hcSeparateVariables}
\end{equation}

Now separate the variables. The limits of integration are the result of setting the vertex of the chain to be at $x=0$. It follows then that $p = dy/dx = 0$ at $x = 0$

\begin{equation}
\int^p_0 \frac{dp}{\sqrt{1+p^{2}}} = \int^x_0\frac{dx}{k}.
\label{equ:hcIntegral}
\end{equation}
By solving the integrals in Equation \ref{equ:hcIntegral}, using a trigonometric substitution, one gets

\begin{equation}
arcsinh(p)=\frac{x}{k}.
\label{equ:hcIntegralSolution}
\end{equation}
Now substitue back in p=dy/dx to get,

\begin{equation}
p=\frac{dy}{dx}=sinh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right),
\label{equ:hcYIntegral}
\end{equation}
and once again solve using employing the separation of variable. One is now left with

\begin{equation}
y-y_{0}=\int^y_{y_{0}}dy=\int^{x}_{x_{0}}sinh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)dx = kcosh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)-k.
\label{equ:hcDiffofY}
\end{equation}



This is the equation for a {\bf catenary} with a vertex at $x_0=0$, $y_0=k$. The axis ${\cal{O}}y$ is called the 
{\bf axis of the catenary} and the quantity $k$ is called the {\bf catenary parameter}.  The ${\cal{O}}x$  axis located
at position $k$ below the vertex is called the {\bf directrix} of the catenary as seen in Figure \ref{fig:hcSuspendedUniforChain2}.

\caption{Suspended uniform chain}

Finally, by dividing Equation \ref{equ:hcLineSegment} by $dx$, one gets

\begin{equation}
\frac{ds}{dx}=\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}=\sqrt{1+sinh^2\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)}=cosh\left(\frac{x}{k}
\right).
\label{equ:hcLineSegment2}
\end{equation}
Once again separations of variables and integration leads to,

\begin{equation}
s=\int^s_0 ds=\int^x_0 cosh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)dx=ksinh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right).
\label{equ:hcLineSegmentIntegrated}
\end{equation}
Since $cosh^2(x)-sinh^2(x)=1$ the solutions to $y(x)$ and $s(x)$, Equations \ref{equ:hcIntegralSolution} and 
\ref{equ:hcLineSegmentIntegrated}, lead to

\begin{equation}
y^{2}=s^{2}+k^{2}.
\label{equ:hcYCoordSquared}
\end{equation}
This relates the y-coordinate of a point on the chain to the length of chain to this point from the lowest point of the chain.

The tension in the chain also varies along its length. This is because the amount of chain suspended at a point changes along the chain length. A relationship between the tension at a point on the chain, and the y-coordinate of this point 
can be derived. From Figure \ref{fig:hcSumOrVectors}, observe that

\begin{equation}
T=\sqrt{T_{H}^{2}+W^{2}}.
\label{equ:hcTension}
\end{equation}
Substituting $W=\omega s$ and $T_{H}=\omega k$, from Equations \ref{equ:hcEquilibrium2} and \ref{equ:hcChainConstant2}, into Equation \ref{equ:hcTension} yields

\begin{equation}
T=\omega\sqrt{s^{2}+k^{2}}.
\label{equ:hcTension2}
\end{equation}
Using Equation \ref{equ:hcYCoordSquared}, this simplifies to

\begin{equation}
T=\omega y.
\label{equ:hcTension3}
\end{equation}
which is an expression for the tension at different points in the chain that relies only on the mass density of the chain, and a point's vertical distance from the vertex of the chain.

The maximum tension occurs at the end points of the chain from where it is suspended. The points of suspension occur at $x = \pm a/2$ where a is the {\bf span}, or  the distance between the suspension point. The suspension points are at the same height of $y = k + d$ where is the {\bf sag}, or the distance from the vertex at $y = k$ to the suspension points A and B, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hcSuspendedUniforChain2}.

Since $cos(\theta) = dx/ds$ the tension T can be written as

\begin{equation}
T=\frac{T_{H}}{cos \theta}=T_{H}\frac{ds}{dx}=T_{H}cosh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)=\frac{T_{H}}{k}y.
\label{equ:hcTension4}
\end{equation} 
Again since T$_{H}$ = $\omega$k Equation \ref{equ:hcTension4} produces the same expression for tension as seen in Equation \ref{equ:hcTension3}. However by setting x to a/2 in Equation \ref{equ:hcTension4} once gets an expression for the maximum tension experience at the suspension points. This expression is

\begin{equation}
T_{max}=T_{H}cosh\left(\frac{a}{2k}\right)=\omega y_{max}=\omega(d+k).
\label{equ:hcTensionMax}
\end{equation}

Although Equation \ref{equ:hcTensionMax} is a simple expression $k$ is still unknown in terms of any measurable quantities. However, using Equation \ref{equ:hcYCoordSquared}, and the fact that $s_{max} = l/s$, where $l$ is the total length of the chain it can be shown that

\begin{equation}
(k+d)^{2}=\left(\frac{l}{2}\right)^{2}+k^{2}.
\label{equ:hcKValue}
\end{equation}
This leads to 

\begin{equation}
k=\frac{l^{2}}{8d}-\frac{d}{2},
\label{equ:hcKValue2}
\end{equation}
and then finally to

\begin{equation}
T_{max}=\omega\left(\frac{l^2}{8d}+\frac{d}{2}\right).
\label{equ:hcTensionMax2}
\end{equation}

The validity of the equations derived above can be tested with the apparatus in Figure \ref{fig:hcExperimentalApparatus}. By hanging a chain from its endpoints at equal heights, the (x,y) coordinates of points on the chain and their
corresponding arc lengths can be measured. Equation \ref{equ:hcDiffofY} can be verified once x and y are known. Equation \ref{equ:hcLineSegmentIntegrated} can be tested once x and s are known. Equation \ref{equ:hcYCoordSquared}
can be confirmed once y and s are measured. By hanging the chain on spring scales and measuring tension at the endpoints, Equation \ref{equ:hcTension3} can be tested. Lastly, Equation \ref{equ:hcTensionMax2} can be tested by varying the sag and observing the endpoint tension

\section{Experimental Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Choose a chain from the assortment provided. Measure the length and mass of the chain. Compute the weight per unit length, $\omega$, of the chain.

\item Suspend the chain by its endpoints to the spring scales as in Figure \ref{fig:hcExperimentalApparatus}. Measure the span and sag of the chain. Determine the chain constant for this arrangement. Raise both ends of the chain so that the 
lowest point is at height k. Both ends of the chain must still be at equal height.

\item The catenary now has the position shown in Figure \ref{fig:hcSuspendedUniforChain2} and Equations \ref{equ:hcDiffofY}, \ref{equ:hcLineSegmentIntegrated}, and \ref{equ:hcYCoordSquared} can be tested. Record the (x,y) coordinates for 
at least ten points along the chain from the lowest point on the chain to one of the endpoints. For each point, also record the length of chain, s, between that point and the lowest point on the chain. Since the chain has a non-negligible 
thickness, measure to the middle of the chain.

\item The sag of the chain can be varied by changing distance between laboratory stands. To test Equation \ref{equ:hcTensionMax}, record the sag and corresponding endpoint tension for at least ten different sags.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}

Since meter sticks are used to measure the position of the various points along the chain, the measurement error is half the smallest division of the meter stick. There will also be an error introduced in judging where the middle 
of the chain is. The meter sticks must also be placed close to the chain without actually touching it. These factors will yield an error in measurement larger than half the smallest division of the meter stick. Decide on an 
appropriate error value for your measurements taking this into account.

When the span of the chain is altered, the tension T$_{max}$ at the endpoints changes. Not only does the value of T$_{max}$ decrease with decreasing span, but the rate at which it changes decreases as well. As the span is decreased,
there is a point beyond which the spring scales cannot resolve the change in tension. So for best results the span should not be too small.

Recall that

\begin{equation}
u(f)=\sqrt{\left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|^{2}u(x)^2+\left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right|^{2}u(y)^2}.
\label{equ:hcGeneralError}
\end{equation}
where f=f(x,y) and u(f) is the uncertainty in f. For Example

\begin{equation}
u\left[cosh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)\right]=\sqrt{\left[\frac{sinh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)}{k}\right]^2u(x)^2
+ \left[\frac{x\ sinh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)}{k^2}\right]^2u(x)^2
}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose a chain with length l and weight density $\omega$ is suspended by one endpoint so that it hangs vertically as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hcVerticallyHangingChain}. Also, the chain is hanging motionless and it can 
support its own weight. Then in that case, at any point along the chain, there must be an upward force holding the chain together. Call this upward force the tension in the chain. What is the tension at any given point along
the chain? Is the tension along the chain constant or changing?

\item The hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine functions can be written in terms of the exponential function as

sinh(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^{x}-e^{-x}\right),

\section{Data Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The values for l, m, $\omega$, a, d, and k.

\item For the data acquired in step 3 of the experimental procedure a table of values for x, y, y$^{2}$, s, s$^{2}$, sinh($\frac{x}{k}$), cosh($\frac{x}{k}$) along with their errors.

\item A graph of y versus cosh($\frac{x}{k}$), a graph of s versus sinh($\frac{x}{k}$), and a graph of y$^{2}$ versus s$^{2}$. For each plot include error bars, a line of best fit and the equation of the line of best fit.

\item For the data acquired in step 4 of the experimental procedure, a table of values for d and T$_{max}$ together with their errors.

\item A graph of Equation \ref{equ:hcTensionMax} (theoretical T$_{max}$ versus d) for physically realizable values of d. Superimpose a plot of the measured T$_{max}$ versus d values on this graph.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item For each of the linearized graphs, discuss what the slope and intercept of the trendline represents. Compare the slopes and intercepts with their expected values.

\item Discuss the appearance of the plot of Equation \ref{equ:hcTensionMax}. Compare the measured values of T$_{max}$ with the expected values.

\item In deriving the equation of the catenary, Equation \ref{equ:hcTan1} is differentiated with respect to x to yield Equation \ref{equ:hcSecondOrderDiff1}. Notice that the horizontal tension T$_{H}$ is treated as a 
constant. This implies that the horizontal component of tension in the chain is constant along the entire chain. Justify why the horizontal component of tension is constant along the length of chain.

\item Discuss any deviations of your observations from Equation \ref{equ:hcTensionMax} in Data Requirement 5. What is a likely source for this deviation? Suggest a modification to the experiment that would reduce the deviation.
\end{enumerate}



\begin{comment} % optional section
\section{ Do any {\bf two} of discussion questions 14 through 18.}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Does the shape of a chain suspended by its endpoints (when the endpoints are not at equal heights) still follow the equation of the catenary? Explain why or why not.

\item Suppose a chain is suspended by its endpoints at an equal height. In the limit that the chain length approaches infinity, explain what happens with the tension at the endpoints, as well as the tangent to the chain at the 
endpoints.

\item Take two chains of length l but with differing weight densities $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$. If the endpoints of these two chains are fastened to the same supports, will the shape of the chains be the same or different?

\item The Taylor series expansion of e$^{x}$ is

\begin{equation}
e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\cdot \cdot \cdot
\label{equ:hcTaylorExp}
\end{equation}
Using this fact, show that the Taylor series expansion of the catenary is
\begin{equation}
y=k\cdot cosh\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)=k \left[ 1+\frac{1}{2!}\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{4!}\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)^{4}+ \frac{1}{6!}\left(\frac{x}{k}\right)^{6} + \cdot \cdot \cdot \right].
\label{equ:hcHangingChainTaylor}
\end{equation}

Use this result to show that for large values of k (small sags), the catenary can be approximated by the parabola
\begin{equation}
y=k+\frac{1}{2k}x^2.
\label{equ:hcParabola}
\end{equation}

\item Unlike a freely hanging chain, a loaded chain can be considered massless if it supports a large weight along its entire length. This situation occurs in suspension bridges. Here, the downward force at each point of the chain 
(neglecting the chain weight) is a constant. In this case, W=$\omega$x and Equation \ref{equ:hcWeightOfChain} becomes
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x}{k}.
\label{equ:hcLoadedChain}
\end{equation}
Show that the loaded chain takes the shape of a parabola. If the lowest point has position (0,k), show that the formula for the shape of a loaded chain is
\begin{equation}
y=k+\frac{1}{2k}x^{2}.
\label{equ:hcLoadedChain2}
\end{equation}

\section{Preparation}

Review the mathematics of the damped harmonic oscillator.

\section{Goal of the Experiment}

To understand and measure the behaviour of a harmonic oscillator system with damping. To gain experience with dynamical systems.

\section{Theory}

A mass hanging from an idealized vertical spring forms a harmonic oscillator. The mass moves with {\bf simple harmonic motion} that will continue on indefinitely. The mass is expected to oscillate forever. However, in a real physical system, the mass bobbing at the end of the spring eventually comes to rest. The amplitude of the oscillations gradually diminishes to zero. This happens because energy is removed from the system. The physical spring gradually converts mechanical energy into thermal energy that is then lost to the environment. Other forces such as air resistance also contribute. All of these energy losses {\bf damp out} the oscillations. A more accurate model of a physical spring and mass system must therefore include energy losses due to {\bf damping}.

Another feature of the idealized spring-mass system is that all energy is input into the system at the start. No further energy is added later. The energy in the mass and spring system is introduced by stretching the spring before release (adding potential energy), or by giving the mass an initial velocity (adding kinetic energy), or both. Once the mass is released, the energy content of the system does not decrease or increase. A system that only has energy input at time zero is called an {\bf unforced} or {\bf undriven} system. %Suppose however that the support the spring hangs from were moved up and down while the mass is moving. Here, energy can be added to the system on a continuous basis. Such a system is called a {\bf forced} or {\bf driven} system. The equation describing how the spring support moves with time is called the {\bf forcing function}. This experiment examines a driven damped harmonic oscillator where the forcing function is a sine wave at a single frequency.

\caption{Forced damped harmonic oscillator}
\label{fig:doForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator}
\end{marginfigure}

Figure \ref{fig:doForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator} shows a forced damped harmonic oscillator. Masses and a damping bar are supported by the spring. The upper end of the spring is not fixed. Instead, it is connected to a driver that changes the position of the upper end of the spring. The spring obeys Hooke's Law with spring constant $k$. The damping bar extends between two permanent magnets. As the bar oscillates, eddy currents are generated in the bar that produce heat, thus removing energy from the oscillator. This damping device is called an {\bf eddy current damper}. Using the index bar, the guide and sensor can measure the system position. 

Coordinates must be assigned to the system in Figure \ref{fig:doForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator} in order to derive the equation of motion. Define the {\bf zero point} as the origin. Let the distance to the {\bf index point} from the zero point be the position, $y$. Define the positive direction to be down. The position of the system is then determined by how far the index point is from the sensor guide zero point, and whether it is above (negative) or below (positive) the sensor guide zero point. 

In the case of the undriven damped harmonic oscillator there are three forces present. There is the force of gravity, a restoring force applied by a spring, and a damping force applied by an eddy current damper. The mass hanging from the end of the spring supplies the force due to gravity. 

The equation of motion for this system can be derived from the expression
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{net}=\vec{F}_{gravity}+\vec{F}_{damp}+\vec{F}_{spring}.
\label{equ:doNewtonsSecondLaw}
\end{equation}

The force of gravity is $F_{gravity}=mg$, where $m$ is the effective total mass given by the mass of the damping bar, the index bar, the extra applied masses, and one third the mass of the spring all added together. The damping force is a velocity dependent force defined by $F_{damp}=-cv$, where $c$ is the damping coefficient, and $v$ is the velocity of the system. Note that the damping force always opposes the direction of motion. The spring force is $F_{spring}=-ky$ where $k$ is the spring constant of the spring, and $y$ is the system's displacement from its equilibrium position.

Equation \ref{equ:doNewtonsSecondLaw} can now be written as,

\begin{equation}
ma=mg-ky-cv.
\label{equ:doEquationOfMotion1}
\end{equation}
If Equation \ref{equ:doEquationOfMotion1} is re-written  in Newton's notation and divided by $m$ the result is a differential equation of the form

\begin{equation}
\ddot{y}+2\gamma\dot{y}+\omega_{0}^{2}y=g,
\label{equ:odEquationOfMotion2}
\end{equation}
where  $\gamma=c/2m$ is the {\bf damping force frequency}, and $\omega_{0}^{2}=k/m$ is the {\bf natural frequency} of the undamped oscillator. This is the equation of motion for the damped undriven harmonic oscillator.

The next step is to find a solution to the homogeneous form $(g=0)$ of Equation \ref{equ:odEquationOfMotion2}. There are three such solutions to this equation. The particular solution in each case is just a constant $y=y_{E}$ where $y_{E}=mg/k$ is the displaced equilibrium point for the spring with the hanging bar. The particular solution is important for the calibration of the instrument, however since it does not affect the time dependency of the function it will be disregarded for now.

that decays exponentially with time, where $\omega_{d}=\sqrt{\omega_{0}^{2}-\gamma^2}$. This oscillation is said to be {\bf underdamped}. Notice that the oscillator frequency has shifted to a frequency that is smaller than the natural frequency of the undamped system. This means that the period of oscillation is $T_{d}=2\pi / \omega_{d}$.

which decays without oscillating, where $\Omega = \sqrt{\gamma^{2}-\omega_{0}^{2}}$. This system is said to be {\bf overdamped}. Since $\Omega$ is real there is no periodicity, and the system simply decays to $y=0$.

\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:doForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator} shows the damped harmonic motion analyzer (DHMA) used in this experiment. The DHMA includes digital readouts necessary for direct measurements of the period, extent of travel, and phase of the index bar. A sinusoidal forcing function is provided with readout and 
adjustment of the driving frequency. Also included, is a manual adjustment for setting and reading the forcing function amplitude.

The DHMA power switch is located at the rear of the unit. The forcing function driving wheel is also located there. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:doForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator}, a manual slide with a scale permits the operator to read and adjust the driving amplitude. The forcing function is engaged and disengaged by the front panel DRIVE switch. The drive frequency $f_{d}=\omega_{d} / 2\pi$ is adjusted with the front panel FREQUENCY control. When the readout 
selector is switched to FREQ., the digital readout gives the forcing frequency, $f_{d}$ , in Hertz.

Observe that the index bar has a scale on one side and a black rectangle on the other side. The black rectangle should be on the right as seen from the front of the DHMA. The blackened and transparent areas on this index bar are used to interrupt a light beam inside the mass guide sensor. The red light on the front of the mass guide is lit whenever the black rectangle is below the guide and off when this rectangle breaks the light beam. The top edge of the black rectangle is the {\bf index point} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:doForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator}. This is considered to be the origin of the coordinate system used by the DHMA. When the mass is oscillating, the flashing phase LED is timed by internal circuitry to give a digital readout of the {\bf period}. The black scale marks on the left side of the index bar are counted as they pass the optical sensor inside the mass guide. The total count of scale marks in each period is a digital measurement of the {\bf travel distance} of the index bar in one period. Lastly, the time difference between when the index point passes the optical sensor and when the forcing function drive wheel passes its zero point gives a digital readout of the {\bf phase}.

In order for the system to perform properly and conform to Equation \ref{equ:odEquationOfMotion2}, the DHMA must be correctly adjusted. The index bar should move through the mass guide and sensor without rubbing. This is accomplished by the levelling screws at the base of the unit and the spade lug connecting the spring to the index bar. Figure \ref{fig:doAlignmentOfDampingBar} gives the details.

The next adjustment to be made sets the forcing function phase to $0^{\circ}$. Move the index bar up and down. Notice that when the phase set LED flashes, so does a lamp inside the phase angle display at the front of the DHMA. Manually turn the driving wheel at the rear of the DHMA until this phase display reads $0^{\circ}$. This adjustment aligns the phase display with the index bar coordinate system.

Lastly, the length of the driving cord needs to be adjusted to conform with the requirements of Equation \ref{equ:odUnderDamped}. This effectively sets the origin of the DHMA coordinate system to be at the index point. Use the drive cord coarse adjust to position the top of the black rectangle even with the phase set LED when the system is at rest. At this position small oscillations of the index bar will cause the phase set LED to turn on and off. Next adjust the drive cord fine adjust at the top of the DHMA until the amplitude of the index bar oscillations that make the phase set LED flash are as small as possible.

%Once these adjustments are completed, the system motion theoretically matches the derivation leading to Equation \ref{equ:doNewtonsSecondLaw3}. 
These adjustments should be rechecked every time the spring is changed or masses are added to 
the index bar. It remains to be experimentally determined whether the actual dynamics of the system correspond to the solution of the damped harmonic oscillator equation as described above.

\section{\bf Experimental Procedure}

\subsection{\bf Measure the Parameters of the System}
According to the equations of motion for the system there are $3$ parameters that govern the motion. The mass $m$, the spring constant $k$, and damping coefficient $c$. All three can be measured. 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Using the digital balance, determine the mass of the spring and the objects hanging from it (the index bar, damping bar, and all additional masses). If the mass of the spring is not negligible, then the effective mass of the system is the sum of the masses hanging from the spring and one third of the spring mass.

\item The spring constant, $k$, is found from Hooke's law. Add mass to the index bar in steps of $5$ to $20$ grams for at least 8 points between $0$ and $100$. Plotting applied force versus extension gives a line with slope $k$. Note that the spring is already extended by the index and damping bars hanging from it. The first data point will then be a spring extension of zero with an applied force of mg Newtons, where $m$ is the mass of the index and damping bars. Use the scale on the index bar to measure the amount of extension.

\item Measure the natural frequency, $\omega_{0}$, of the system. Remove the damping magnets from the system, and set the FUNCTION switch to PERIOD. Pull and release the damping bar. The digital display should stabilize to a roughly constant reading for the period of the system. Determine the period for at least five different masses {\bf including no extra mass}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\bf Align and Calibrate the Apparatus}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item Align the DHMA as shown in Figure \ref{fig:doAlignmentOfDampingBar}. This can be done by adjusting the two levelling feet on the bottom of the apparatus, and by twisting the eye that attaches the spring to the bar.  A realignment should be carried out any time an extra mass is added or the spring is changed. If the DHMA is moved or bumped the alignment should be rechecked.

\item The solid bar detects when the top of the black bar passes in front of the sensor, and when this happens the LED in the sensor housing will blink. When the spring is in equilibrium, the top of the solid black bar on the index bar should coincide with the optical sensor. Use the coarse and fine drive cord adjust to position the bar so the the smallest of perturbations of the mass causes the LED to blink. It may even be possible to position the bar so that when the mass is stationary the LED will flicker. If the LED does not blink at all try taking the index bar out, rotate it horizontally, and put it back in place. Be sure to realign as per step 1. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\bf Determine the Damping Coefficient and Frequency for System with Minimum Damping}
Recall that the equation of motion for an underdamped oscillator is 
\begin{equation}
y(t)=Ae^{-\gamma t}cos\left(\omega_{d}t+\phi\right),
\label{equ:doUnderDampedAgain}
\end{equation}
and that the period of the the system is,
\begin{equation}
T=2\pi / \omega_{d}.
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Adjust the magnet positions for minimum damping (magnets as far away from the damping bar as possible). Measure the magnet spacing with calipers.

\item Measure the damped frequency, $\omega_{d}$, of the system. Set the FUNCTION switch to PERIOD. Pull and release the damping bar. The digital display should stabilize to a roughly constant reading for the period of the system. %Determine the period for at least five different masses {\bf including no extra mass}.

\label{fig:doUndrivenAndUnderdamped}
\end{marginfigure}


\item Determine the damping coefficient $c$. For the DHMA, the system is always underdamped when magnetic damping is used regardless of the position of the magnets.  In the undriven underdamped case Figure \ref{fig:doUndrivenAndUnderdamped} shows that the peak amplitudes of the motion lie on an exponential curve.

Notice that Equation \ref{equ:doUnderDampedAgain} predicts that $y(t)$ will be a maximum whenever $\omega_{d}t-\phi = 2\pi$, or rather $cos\left(\omega_{d}t-\phi\right) =1$. Equation \ref{equ:doUnderDampedAgain} can be written as 
\begin{equation}
y(t)=Ae^{-\gamma T N},
\label{equ:doDecayPerCycle} 
\end{equation} 
where $N$ is the total number of cycles. 
Finally by taking the natural log of each side Equation \ref{equ:doDecayPerCycle} becomes,
\begin{equation}
ln(y)=-\gamma T N +ln(A).
\label{equ:doDecayPerCycle2}
\end{equation}
A graph of logarithm of peak amplitudes versus $N$ gives a line with slope of $-\gamma T =-cT / 2 m$, from which the damping coefficient can be determined. Set the FUNCTION switch to AMPL and DRIVE off. Pull the damping bar down and release it. Watch the digital readout and observe that the peak amplitudes decrease with time as expected. Obtain data of amplitude versus oscillation number for $50$ to $100$ cycles. Note the amplitude every fourth or fifth cycle.

\subsection{\bf Determine the Damping Coefficient and Frequency for System with Maximum Damping}

\item Move the magnets as close together as possible without rubbing the damping bar to get maximum damping. Measure the magnet spacing and then repeat steps $5$, $6$, and $7$. Since the oscillations may damp out quickly, the peak amplitude has to be noted down more often than every fourth or fifth cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{comment}

\item Determine the resonance curve of the system. Set the amplitude of the forcing function to 1mm. Any larger and the system will move out of range at resonance. Adjust the damping magnets for minimum damping and leave no extra masses on 
the bar. For frequencies from 0.5 Hz to 3.0 Hz in increments of about 0.2 Hz, determine the steady state amplitude. Set the FUNCTION switch to FREQ and DRIVE on. Adjust the FREQUENCY control until the digital display reads the desired 
driving frequency. Then set the FUNCTION switch to AMPL and measure the peak amplitude. Remember to let the amplitude reading stabilize so that the steady state solution is measured and not the natural solution. Near resonance the 
frequencies should be stepped at smaller intervals. Determine the frequency that gives maximum response.

\item Perform any one of the following investigations.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Show that all the undriven solutions decay to zero if damping is present. Show that without an initial displacement or initial velocity the undriven system remains motionless for all time. For an undriven system that is undamped or 
underdamped, is it possible to make the mass oscillate at a higher frequency by pulling harder on the mass to start it moving? Why or why not? Design and implement an experiment to test this. Present your results.

\item In the driven underdamped case, the form of the steady state solution suggests that the steady state amplitude is directly proportional to the driving amplitude. Design and implement an experiment to test this. Present your results.

\item Design and implement an experiment to examine how the amplitude at resonance changes with different amounts of damping. Present your results.

\item If the damping magnets are removed completely, the DHMA can roughly simulate an undamped system. Use this fact to design and implement an experiment to examine beat frequencies. Also use the fact that the effect of damping on the 
natural frequency is minimized when the mass m is large.

\item Design and implement an experiment that examines how the damping constant varies with the spacing of the magnets. Present your results.

\item Plot the phase difference between the mass bar and the driving wheel as a function of frequency and compare your results with the theoretical formula.

\item It is possible to compute the phase for which maximum power is delivered to the mass bar. Use the power formula

\begin{equation}
P=F\frac{dx}{dt},
\end{equation}
where the driving force, F, is of the form
\begin{equation}
F=F_{0}cos\left(\omega t + \theta \right),
\end{equation}
and the position of the system, x, has the form
\begin{equation}
x=A_{0}cos\left(\omega t \right).
\end{equation}

Integrate P over the time of one full oscillation to find the energy per oscillation with respect to the phase angle $\theta$. Find the value $\omega_{max}$ for $\theta$ which maximizes the energy per oscillation. Near which frequency 
would you expect maximum power to be delivered to the mass bar? In the driven underdamped case examine the formula for the phase angle $\theta$. Which value of $\omega_{d}$ gives a phase angle of $\theta_{max}$? Is this the resonant 
frequency? Why or why not?

\item Derive the actual equation of the forcing function from the geometry of the drive wheel and cam. Show that it approximates Equation \ref{equ:doForcingFunction} under the conditions of the experiment.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}

A major source of error in this experiment is the deviation of the mass spring system from the ideal. The largest error is motion of the spring and masses in other directions than the vertical, which cannot be readily quantified with this apparatus. The masses as found on the digital balance can be considered to be exact. The frequency and period measurements made by the DHMA can also be assumed to be exact. The amplitude measurements are made by the instrument internally and electronically. Since the exact measurement process is not known and the error not documented a reasonable error cannot be determined. However, the DHMA measurement errors are smaller than perturbations from nonvertical motions of the mass spring system itself. This leaves the error in measuring the spring extension which is half the smallest division on the index bar. Since most of the errors are small or unquantified, error analysis is not required for this experiment.

\section{Preparation}

Review the mathematics of the forced damped harmonic oscillator.

\section{Goal of the Experiment}

To understand and measure the behaviour of a forced harmonic oscillator system with damping. To gain experience with dynamical systems.

\section{Theory}

A mass hanging from an idealized vertical spring forms a harmonic oscillator. The mass moves with {\bf simple harmonic motion} that will continue on indefinitely. The mass is expected to oscillate forever. However, in a real physical system, the mass bobbing at the end of the spring eventually comes to rest. The amplitude of the oscillations gradually diminishes to zero. This happens because energy is removed from the system. The physical spring gradually converts mechanical energy into thermal energy that is then lost to the environment. Other forces such as air resistance also contribute. All of these energy losses {\bf damp out} the oscillations. A more accurate model of a physical spring and mass system must therefore include energy losses due to {\bf damping}.

Another feature of the idealized spring-mass system is that all energy is input into the system at the start. No further energy is added later. The energy in the mass and spring system is introduced by stretching the spring before release (adding potential energy), or by giving the mass an initial velocity (adding kinetic energy), or both. Once the mass is released, the energy content of the system does not decrease or increase. A system that only has energy input at time zero is called an {\bf unforced} or {\bf undriven} system. 

Suppose however that the support the spring hangs from were moved up and down while the mass is moving. Here, energy can be added to the system on a continuous basis. Such a system is called a {\bf forced} or {\bf driven} system. The equation describing how the spring support moves with time is called the {\bf forcing function}. This experiment examines a driven damped harmonic oscillator where the forcing function is a cosine wave at a single frequency.

\caption{Forced damped harmonic oscillator}
\label{fig:foForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator}
\end{marginfigure}

Figure \ref{fig:foForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator} shows a forced damped harmonic oscillator. Masses and a damping bar are supported by the spring. The upper end of the spring is not fixed. Instead, it is connected to a driver that changes the position of the upper end of the spring. The spring obeys Hooke's Law with spring constant $k$. The damping bar extends between two permanent magnets. As the bar oscillates, eddy currents are generated in the bar that produce heat, thus removing energy from the oscillator. This damping device is called an {\bf eddy current damper}. Using the index bar, the guide and sensor can measure the system position. 

Coordinates must be assigned to the system in Figure \ref{fig:foForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator} in order to derive the equation of motion. Define the {\bf zero point} as the origin. Let the distance to the {\bf index point} from the zero point be the position, $y$. Define the positive direction to be down. The position of the system is then determined by how far the index point is from the sensor guide zero point, and whether it is above (negative) or below (positive) the 
sensor guide zero point. 

In the case of the driven damped harmonic oscillator there are three forces present. There is the driving force, a restoring force applied by a spring, and a damping force applied by an eddy current damper.

The equation of motion for this system can be derived from the expression
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{net}=\vec{F}_{drive}+\vec{F}_{damp}+\vec{F}_{spring}.
\label{equ:foNewtonsSecondLaw}
\end{equation}

The driving force a periodic function defined by $F_{drive}=F_{0}cos(\omega t)$, where $F_{0}$ is the maximum magnitude of the driving force, and $\omega$ is the frequency of the driving force. The damping force is a velocity dependent force defined by $F_{damp}=-cv$, where $c$ is the damping coefficient, and $v$ is the velocity of the system. Note that the damping force always opposes the direction of motion. The spring force is $F_{spring}=-ky$ where $k$ is the spring constant of the spring, and $y$ is the system's displacement from its equilibrium position.

Equation \ref{equ:foNewtonsSecondLaw} can now be written as,

\begin{equation}
ma=F_{0}cos(\omega t)-ky-cv,
\label{equ:foEquationOfMotion1}
\end{equation} 
where $m$ is the effective total mass given by the mass of the damping bar, the index bar, the extra applied masses, and one third the mass of the spring all added together.

If Equation \ref{equ:foEquationOfMotion1} is re-written  in Newton's notation and divided by $m$ the result is a differential equation of the form
\begin{equation}
\ddot{y}+ 2 \gamma \dot{y} + \omega_{0}^{2}y =\frac{F_{0}}{m}cos(\omega t),
\label{equ:foEquationOfMotion2}
\end{equation}
where  $\gamma=c/2m$ is the {\bf damping force frequency}, and $\omega_{0}^{2}=k/m$ is the {\bf natural frequency} of the undamped oscillator. This is the equation of motion for the damped undriven harmonic oscillator.

\marginnote{For a complete derivation of equations \ref{equ:foAmplitude} and \ref{equ:foPhase} see Fowles \& Cassiday, "Analytical Mechanics", 7th ed. pg 113-117.}

This system will go from rest to a steady oscillation at the same frequency $\omega$. The amplitude and phase of the oscillations depends dramatically on the driving frequency, $\omega$. The amplitude, A, of the oscillation is

\begin{equation}
A(\omega)=\frac{F_{0} / m}{\sqrt{(\omega_{0}^{2}-\omega^{2})^{2}+4\gamma^{2}\omega^{2}}},
\label{equ:foAmplitude}
\end{equation}
and the phase of the oscillation is
\begin{equation}
tan(\phi)=\frac{2\gamma \omega}{\omega_{0}^{2}-\omega^{2}}.
\label{equ:foPhase}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:foResonanceCurve} shows a plot of the amplitude's dependence on the driving frequency.  The horizontal axis gives a measure of the driving frequency in terms of the natural frequency, $\omega_0$.  Similarly the amplitude is given in units of $F_0/k$. Observe that when the driving frequency vanishes ($\omega = 0$) all the amplitudes converge to the same value ($A(0) = F/k$).

Figure \ref{fig:foResonanceCurve} also shows that there is a peak, more pronounced the less damping there is, for a particular value of the driving frequency. This frequency is known as the \textbf{resonant frequency}, $\omega_{r}$, which is given by

\begin{equation}
\omega_{r}=\sqrt{\omega_{0}^{2}-2\gamma^{2}},
\label{equ:foResonantFrequency}
\end{equation} 
which can be derived by taking the derivative of Equation \ref{equ:foAmplitude} with respect to $\omega$ and setting the result to zero.

Notice that Equation \ref{equ:foResonantFrequency} suggests that as the resonance frequency decreases as the damping force increases. It is also worth noting that the amplitude of the oscillator decreases as the driving frequency increases. This is due to that fact that the oscillator has a more difficult time responding to the higher frequencies, and therefore will not be able to increase its amplitude. 

The phase of the oscillation relative to that of the driving force also varies with the driving frequency, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:foPhase}. At very low driving frequencies, the oscillation is essentially in phase with the driving force, while at very high frequencies the oscillation tends to be out of phase with the driving force by 180$^\circ$ (or $\phi = \pi$). The transition is again clearer with low damping. Equation \ref{equ:foPhase} shows that when $\omega = \omega_0$ the phase $\phi = \pi/2$ (since $\tan \phi \rightarrow \infty$) for all possible values of the damping constant $\gamma$.  This is also seen in Figure \ref{fig:foResonanceCurve} where all of the phase transitions pass through $\phi = \pi/2$ for $\omega/\omega_0 = 1$.

Figures \ref{fig:foResonanceCurve} and \ref{fig:foPhase} show the dependence of both the amplitude and phase of the forced harmonic oscillator on both the driving frequency $\omega$ and damping constant $\gamma$. The experiment in this lab will primarily focus on the creating an amplitude-frequency curve similar to that shown in Figure \ref{fig:foResonanceCurve}.
\\
%This experiment will examine the undriven underdamped harmonic oscillator with two different magnitudes of damping force. %operating in several of the modes described above. The apparatus permits measurements of the system position so that the theoretical equations of motion can be checked.

Figure \ref{fig:foForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator} shows the damped harmonic motion analyzer (DHMA) used in this experiment. The DHMA includes digital readouts necessary for direct measurements of the period, extent of travel, and phase of the index bar. A sinusoidal forcing function is provided with readout and 
adjustment of the driving frequency. Also included, is a manual adjustment for setting and reading the forcing function amplitude.

The DHMA power switch is located at the rear of the unit. The forcing function driving wheel is also located there. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:foForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator}, a manual slide with a scale permits the operator to read and adjust the driving amplitude. The forcing function is engaged and disengaged by the front panel DRIVE switch. The drive frequency $f_{d}=\omega_{d} / 2\pi$ is adjusted with the front panel FREQUENCY control. When the readout 
selector is switched to FREQ., the digital readout gives the forcing frequency, $f_{d}$ , in Hertz.

Observe that the index bar has a scale on one side and a black rectangle on the other side. The black rectangle should be on the right as seen from the front of the DHMA. The blackened and transparent areas on this index bar are used to interrupt a light beam inside the mass guide sensor. The red light on the front of the mass guide is lit whenever the black rectangle is below the guide and off when this rectangle breaks the light beam. The top edge of the black rectangle is the {\bf index point} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:foForcedDampedHarmonicOscillator}. This is considered to be the origin of the coordinate system used by the DHMA. When the mass is oscillating, the flashing phase LED is timed by internal circuitry to give a digital readout of the {\bf period}. The black scale marks on the left side of the index bar are counted as they pass the optical sensor inside the mass guide. The total count of scale marks in each period is a digital measurement of the {\bf travel distance} of the index bar in one period. Lastly, the time difference between when the index point passes the optical sensor and when the forcing function drive wheel passes its zero point gives a digital readout of the {\bf phase}.

In order for the system to perform properly and conform to Equation \ref{equ:foEquationOfMotion2}, the DHMA must be correctly adjusted. The index bar should move through the mass guide and sensor without rubbing. This is accomplished by the levelling screws at the base of the unit and the spade lug connecting the spring to the index bar. Figure \ref{fig:foAlignmentOfDampingBar} gives the details.

The next adjustment to be made sets the forcing function phase to $0^{\circ}$. Move the index bar up and down. Notice that when the phase set LED flashes, so does a lamp inside the phase angle display at the front of the DHMA. Manually turn the driving wheel at the rear of the DHMA until this phase display reads $0^{\circ}$. This adjustment aligns the phase display with the index bar coordinate system.

Lastly, the length of the driving cord needs to be adjusted to conform with the requirements of Equation \ref{equ:foAmplitude}. This effectively sets the origin of the DHMA coordinate system to be at the index point. Use the drive cord coarse adjust to position the top of the black rectangle even with the phase set LED when the system is at rest. At this position small oscillations of the index bar will cause the phase set LED to turn on and off. Next adjust the drive cord fine adjust at the top of the DHMA until the amplitude of the index bar oscillations that make the phase set LED flash are as small as possible.

These adjustments should be rechecked every time the spring is changed or masses are added to 
the index bar. It remains to be experimentally determined whether the actual dynamics of the system correspond to the solution of the forced damped harmonic oscillator equation as described above.

\section{\bf Experimental Procedure}

\subsection{\bf Measure the Parameters of the System}
According to the equations of motion for the system there are $3$ parameters that govern the motion. The mass $m$, the spring constant $k$, and damping coefficient $c$. All three can be measured. 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Using the digital balance, determine the mass of the spring and the objects hanging from it (the index bar, damping bar, and all additional masses). If the mass of the spring is not negligible, then the effective mass of the system is the sum of the masses hanging from the spring and one third of the spring mass.

\item The spring constant, $k$, is found from Hooke's law. Add mass to the index bar in steps of $5$ to $20$ grams for at least 8 points between $0$ and $100$. Plotting applied force versus extension gives a line with slope $k$. Note that the spring is already extended by the index and damping bars hanging from it. The first data point will then be a spring extension of zero with an applied force of mg Newtons, where $m$ is the mass of the index and damping bars. Use the scale on the index bar to measure the amount of extension.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{\bf Align and Calibrate the Apparatus}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]


\item Align the DHMA as shown in Figure \ref{fig:foAlignmentOfDampingBar}. This can be done by adjusting the two levelling feet on the bottom of the apparatus, and by twisting the eye that attaches the spring to the bar.  A realignment should be carried out any time an extra mass is added or the spring is changed. If the DHMA is moved or bumped the alignment should be rechecked.

\item The solid bar detects when the top of the black bar passes in front of the sensor, and when this happens the LED in the sensor housing will blink. When the spring is in equilibrium, the top of the solid black bar on the index bar should coincide with the optical sensor. Use the coarse and fine drive cord adjust to position the bar so the the smallest of perturbations of the mass causes the LED to blink. It may even be possible to position the bar so that when the mass is stationary the LED will flicker. If the LED does not blink at all try taking the index bar out, rotate it horizontally, and put it back in place. Be sure to realign as per step 1.% Recall that the natural frequency of the system is $\omega_{0}=\sqrt{k/m}$.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{\bf Determine the Maximum and Minimum Damping Coefficient}
The equation of motion for an underdamped oscillator is 
\begin{equation}
y(t)=Ae^{-\gamma t}cos\left(\omega_{d}t+\phi\right),
\label{equ:foUnderDampedAgain}
\end{equation}
and that the period of the system is,
\begin{equation}
T=2\pi / \omega_{d},
\label{equ:foDampedPeriod}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the period, and $\omega_{d}$ is the damped frequency of the damped oscillator.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adjust the magnet positions for minimum damping (magnets as far away from the damping bar as possible). Measure the magnet spacing with calipers.

\item Measure the damped frequency, $\omega_{d}$, of the system with {\bf no extra mass attached to the bar}. Set the FUNCTION switch to PERIOD. Pull and release the damping bar. The digital display should stabilize to a roughly constant reading for the period of the system.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Undriven and Underdamped}
\label{fig:foUndrivenAndUnderdamped}
\end{marginfigure}

\item Determine the damping coefficient $c$. For the DHMA, the system is always underdamped when magnetic damping is used regardless of the position of the magnets.  In the undriven underdamped case Figure \ref{fig:foUndrivenAndUnderdamped} shows that the peak amplitudes of the motion lie on an exponential curve.


Notice that Equation \ref{equ:foUnderDampedAgain} predicts that $y(t)$ will be a maximum whenever $\omega_{d}t-\phi = 2\pi$, or rather $cos\left(\omega_{d}t-\phi\right) =1$. Equation \ref{equ:foUnderDampedAgain} can be written as 
\begin{equation}
y(t)=Ae^{-\gamma T N},
\label{equ:foDecayPerCycle} 
\end{equation} 
where $N$ is the total number of cycles. 
Finally by taking the natural log of each side Equation \ref{equ:foDecayPerCycle} becomes,
\begin{equation}
ln(y)=-\gamma T N +ln(A).
\label{equ:foDecayPerCycle2}
\end{equation}
A graph of logarithm of peak amplitudes versus $N$ gives a line with slope of $-\gamma T =-cT / 2 m$, from which the damping coefficient can be determined. Set the FUNCTION switch to AMPL and DRIVE off. Pull the damping bar down and release it. Watch the digital readout and observe that the peak amplitudes decrease with time as expected. Obtain data of amplitude versus oscillation number for $50$ to $100$ cycles. Note the amplitude every fourth or fifth cycle.

% Notice that Equation \ref{equ:foUnderDampedAgain} predicts that $y(t)$ will be a maximum whenever $\omega_{d}t-\phi = 2\pi$, or rather $cos\left(\omega_{d}t-\phi\right) =1$. Equation \ref{equ:foUnderDampedAgain} can be written as 
%\begin{equation}

Obtain data of amplitude versus oscillation number for $50$ to $100$ cycles. Note the amplitude every fourth or fifth cycle.

\item Move the magnets as close together as possible without rubbing the damping bar to get maximum damping. Measure the magnet spacing and then repeat steps $5$ - $7$. Since the oscillations may damp out quickly, the peak amplitude has to be noted down more often than every fourth or fifth cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\bf Determine the Resonance Curves of the Systems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item Set the amplitude of the forcing function to 1 mm. Any larger and the system will move out of range at resonance. Adjust the damping magnets for minimum damping and leave no extra masses on the bar. Set the FUNCTION switch to FREQ and DRIVE on.

\item To make a measurement adjust the FREQUENCY control until the digital display reads the desired driving frequency. Then set the FUNCTION switch to AMPL and measure the peak amplitude. Remember to let the amplitude reading stabilize so that the steady state solution is measured. Near resonance the frequencies should be stepped at smaller intervals. Record the steady-state amplitude, phase of the driving force, and a record of if the phase is leading or lagging (plus for leading and minus for lagging)

\item For frequencies from 0.5 Hz to 3.0 Hz in increments of about 0.2 Hz, determine the steady state amplitude and phase.

\item Determine the frequency that gives maximum response.

\item Repeat steps 9 - 12 for the system with maximum damping.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{comment}
\item Perform any one of the following investigations.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Show that all the undriven solutions decay to zero if damping is present. Show that without an initial displacement or initial velocity the undriven system remains motionless for all time. For an undriven system that is undamped or 
underdamped, is it possible to make the mass oscillate at a higher frequency by pulling harder on the mass to start it moving? Why or why not? Design and implement an experiment to test this. Present your results.

\item In the driven underdamped case, the form of the steady state solution suggests that the steady state amplitude is directly proportional to the driving amplitude. Design and implement an experiment to test this. Present your results.

\item Design and implement an experiment to examine how the amplitude at resonance changes with different amounts of damping. Present your results.

\item If the damping magnets are removed completely, the DHMA can roughly simulate an undamped system. Use this fact to design and implement an experiment to examine beat frequencies. Also use the fact that the effect of damping on the 
natural frequency is minimized when the mass m is large.

\item Design and implement an experiment that examines how the damping constant varies with the spacing of the magnets. Present your results.

\item Plot the phase difference between the mass bar and the driving wheel as a function of frequency and compare your results with the theoretical formula.

\item It is possible to compute the phase for which maximum power is delivered to the mass bar. Use the power formula

\begin{equation}
P=F\frac{dx}{dt},
\end{equation}
where the driving force, F, is of the form
\begin{equation}
F=F_{0}cos\left(\omega t + \theta \right),
\end{equation}
and the position of the system, x, has the form
\begin{equation}
x=A_{0}cos\left(\omega t \right).
\end{equation}

Integrate P over the time of one full oscillation to find the energy per oscillation with respect to the phase angle $\theta$. Find the value $\omega_{max}$ for $\theta$ which maximizes the energy per oscillation. Near which frequency 
would you expect maximum power to be delivered to the mass bar? In the driven underdamped case examine the formula for the phase angle $\theta$. Which value of $\omega_{d}$ gives a phase angle of $\theta_{max}$? Is this the resonant 
frequency? Why or why not?

\item Derive the actual equation of the forcing function from the geometry of the drive wheel and cam. Show that it approximates Equation \ref{equ:foForcingFunction} under the conditions of the experiment.

\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{comment}

\section{\bf Error Analysis}

A major source of error in this experiment is the deviation of the mass spring system from the ideal. The largest error is motion of the spring and masses in other directions than the vertical, which cannot be readily quantified with this apparatus. The masses as found on the digital balance can be considered to be exact. The frequency and period measurements made by the DHMA can also be assumed to be exact. The amplitude measurements are made by the instrument internally and electronically. Since the exact measurement process is not known and the error not documented a reasonable error cannot be determined. However, the DHMA measurement errors are smaller than perturbations from nonvertical motions of the mass spring system itself. This leaves the error in measuring the spring extension which is half the smallest division on the index bar. Since most of the errors are small or unquantified, error analysis is not required for this experiment.

\chapter{Laboratory Safety}

\section{Introduction}
People who survive to reach adulthood generally acquire a mental list of safety rules that are followed to prevent injury to themselves and others. These rules are learned 
from sources such as parents, teachers, and experience. However, the practice of experimental physics can involve the handling of materials, instruments, and processes that
lie outside the realm of common experience. The rules described here must be added to your mental list to handle these new situations. This is part of your education in 
physics. For the safety of yourself and others you are required to read, understand, and follow these guidelines.

All of the physics experiments you will perform have been designed with the safety of the student in mind. This necessarily assumes that all the apparatus is used in a 
reasonable manner. Do not mishandle or abuse the equipment. Use your common sense. Always maintain an awareness of the consequences of your actions for yourself and others.
No food, drink, or smoking is permitted in the laboratory, to reduce the chance that it will be contaminated before being consumed. Also, spilled drinks can be dangerous 
near electrical equipment. Some physics experiments use ice or ice water for cooling. Do not eat or drink the ice or ice water, since it may be contaminated. Never work in a
laboratory alone, there should always be someone else present to get help if necessary. In the event of any accident in the lab, you must notify your instructor immediately.
The following comments describe the hazards you may encounter while in a physics laboratory and the relevant safety procedures to follow.

\section{Heavy Metals}
Lead is used for shielding in radiation experiments. Heavy metals such as lead can be absorbed into your body through the skin and mouth. They accumulate in the brain and 
eventually cause brain damage when a large enough amount is present. The total dosage of lead in the brain builds up over your lifetime as a function of total  accumulated 
exposure. Minimize your exposure to lead in the laboratory by handling it as little as possible. Do not touch any food or your face while working with lead. Wash your hands
after handling lead objects. Lead is also very dense. Be aware of this when moving blocks of lead and do not drop them.

Observe the same precautions when doing an experiment that uses mercury. As with lead, mercury can also be absorbed into the body to accumulate over your lifetime. Mercury 
has the added properties that it is a liquid which can be spilled and any open container of liquid mercury produces mercury vapour which can be inhaled. Avoid spilling 
mercury and try to keep it in a sealed container if possible. Make sure there is a spill tray underneath any experiment that involves the use of mercury. If mercury does get
spilled, notify your instructor so that it can be cleaned up. 

\section{Radiation}
The total dose of radiation you receive depends on the source intensity, the time you are exposed, and your distance from the source. For x-rays and gamma-rays the source 
intensity drops as the inverse square of the distance. For alpha and beta particles the drop is even faster. Minimize the time that a radioactive source is near you. Keep 
radioactive sources  as far away from you as you reasonably can, consistent with doing the experiment. There are strict regulations about the storage and handling of 
radioactive sources. Do not open, drop or lose them.

\section{Lasers}
Lasers are sources of concentrated parallel beams of monochromatic light, which can quite easily be focussed to tiny spots where the power density is high enough to cause 
damage. Never look into a laser beam, or let it shine into your eye, since you may suffer retinal damage if the laser power is high enough. Reflections from polished 
surfaces are almost as dangerous as the direct beam. Never shine a laser into someone elseâs eyes. Resist the temptation to shine the laser around the room or into the 
hallway. If this is done a person could accidentally gaze into the beam.

\section{Rotating Machinery}
Some experiments use pumps, motors, or other moving mechanisms. Keep fingers and other appendages away from such devices. Be especially careful about long hair and 
loose clothing.

\section{Electricity}
Always wire together your circuits with the power off. Make sure the circuit power is off when changing or moving components around. If you must work on live 
circuits only touch the insulated portions and make sure one hand is in your pocket or behind your back. This eliminates the possibility of current flow through the heart 
and lungs, which can be fatal. Do not touch live exposed connections under any circumstances. Beware of loose wires which can fall off or make unintentional connections, 
usually with undesirable results. Be especially vigilant around high voltage circuits. If the voltage is high enough, it is not necessary to touch the circuit to get a 
shock, since sparks can jump across a gap of air. Capacitors require particular care since they can store charge internally for hours after being disconnected from a 
circuit. Make sure capacitors are discharged before touching the terminals. When using spark timers on the air tracks make sure the hands of all your lab partners are clear
before starting the spark source.

\section{Cryogenic Materials}
Some physics experiments involve the use of liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, dry ice, or an organic solvent cooled with dry ice. These materials are cold. Do not touch them 
with your hands. Wear protective gloves when handling a container containing a cryogenic material. Do not splash or spill these cold liquids. Be careful not to touch parts 
that have been in contact with a cryogenic material, they will be cold as well. If a spill does happen, notify your instructor but do not touch the spill, it will evaporate
naturally. There must always be a way for evaporated cryogenic liquid to escape from a vessel, otherwise a dangerous build-up of pressure will occur.

\section{Pressure and vacuum vessels}
Gas bottles are under high pressure. If they are breached they will explode with the force of a bomb. Never jar or mishandle a pressure vessel when it is pressurized. 
Vacuum systems will implode when breached. Do not jar or abuse them either. Always bring the vacuum (or pressure) back to normal slowly. Before adjusting any valves make 
sure you understand the purpose of each valve and the consequences of operating it. Turn it slowly at first so you can change your mind if something seems to be wrong.

\section{Microwaves}
People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting electro-metallic implants should refrain from doing physics experiments that involve microwaves.

\section{Strong Magnetic Fields}
Strong magnetic fields will erase your credit cards, computer disks, and audio tapes. They will also damage watches, tape players, and other electronic devices. Do not leave
any such objects near a strong magnet or electromagnet. Check the area around an electromagnet before turning it on. People wearing heart pacemakers or other life supporting
electro-metallic implants should also refrain from doing physics experiments that involve powerful magnetic fields. Anything containing a magnet, or magnetic material like 
iron, steel, nickel, or cobalt, should also be kept away from strong magnetic fields. They may be damaged or pulled into the region of the field with enough force to break 
something.

\section{Stroboscopes}
Some people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or severe migraine headaches if they view strobe lights flashing at a frequency of 5 to 25 Hz. Refrain from doing an 
experiment involving strobe lights if you know you are susceptible. Notify the instructor immediately if you see someone adversely affected by an operating stroboscope.

To examine light travel in rectangles and equilateral triangles using the laws of reflection and refraction,  or to verify the lensmakers equation.

\section{Theory}
Materials transparent to light are called {\bf optical materials}. It has been found that the speed of light varies in different optical materials. The speed of light is highest in a vacuum. In air the speed is slightly slower. In a solid optical material like glass the speed of light can be less than half of the speed of light in free space. This speed of light difference is an important property of optical materials. The {\bf index of refraction}, or {\bf refractive index}, of an optical material is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the material. The refractive index of empty space is $1.0$, while the refractive index of all other optical materials is greater than $1.0$. The refractive index of air is about $1.0003$ while the index of refraction of the acrylic plastic used in this experiment is $1.49$.

\label{fig:rr1}
\end{marginfigure}

When a ray of light passes between two optical materials, part of the ray is {\bf reflected} and stays in the first medium while  the remainder is {\bf refracted} and passes into the second medium. Figure \ref{fig:rr1} shows a ray of light crossing an optical boundary. Let the index of refraction of the first medium be $n$ and the second medium be $n'$. A line perpendicular to the boundary called the {\bf surface normal}, $N$, is used to measure the angles of the light rays. The angle the incident ray makes with the normal is called the {\bf angle of incidence}, $\varphi$. The angle the reflected ray makes with the normal is called the {\bf angle of reflection} and the angle the refracted ray makes is called the {\bf angle of refraction}, $\varphi '$. It has been found that the behaviour of reflected and refracted rays can each be described by a law.
	
	
The {\bf law of reflection} states that "{\it the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection and the reflected ray is on the opposite side of the normal from the incident ray and the incident ray, surface normal, and reflected ray all lie in the same plane}". The {\bf law of refraction} states that "{\it the sine of the angle of incidence and the the sine of the angle of refraction are in constant ratio to each other and the refracted ray lies on the opposite side of the normal from the incident ray and the incident ray, surface normal, and refracted ray all lie in the same plane}". The law of refraction is also known as {\bf Snell's law}. The constant in Snell's law is the ratio of the refractive indices of the two materials $n$ and $n'$. The law of refraction is usually written as

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\sin\varphi}{\sin\varphi'}=\dfrac{n'}{n}
\label{equ:rr1}
\end{equation}

There are three possible cases; $n<n'$, $n=n'$, and $n>n'$. When $n<n'$, the light rays pass from a rarified medium like air to a denser medium like glass. The reflected portion of the light remains in the rarified medium. This is called {\bf external reflection}. As expected from the law of reflection, the incident ray and the reflected ray both are at the same angle with respect to the normal. The refracted part of the light enters the glass with an angle $\varphi '$ that is determined by the law of refraction. For the smallest possible incident angle of $0^{\circ}$ the refracted ray is also at $0^{\circ}$. For other incident angles the angle of refraction will always be {\bf smaller} than the incident angle.

The case $n=n'$ happens when light passes through a boundary between two materials with the same index of refraction or through a single material without a boundary.  Here, the angle of incidence always equals the angle of refraction. So the path of the incident ray and the path of the refracted ray are identical. As a ray of light travels through a single medium it can be imagined that there is an imaginary boundary with $n=n'$ at every point along the path of the light ray. At every boundary, the refracted ray is in the same path as the incident ray. It appears as if the ray travels through the material in a straight line. This explains why light rays travel in straight lines and cast shadows.

The case of $n>n'$ happens when light from a denser medium like acrylic enters a rarer medium like air. The reflected part of the light stays inside the acrylic. This is called {\bf internal reflection} and obeys the law of reflection as expected. The refracted part of the incident ray leaves the acrylic and enters the air with an angle $\varphi '$ that is found from the law of refraction. As with the other two cases, an incident angle of $0^{\circ}$ refracts to an angle of $0^{\circ}$. For all other incident angles the refracted angle will be {\bf larger} than the incident angle. At the critical angle, $\varphi '_c$, given by
\begin{equation}
\varphi_c'=\sin^{-1}\left(\dfrac{n}{n'}\right)
\label{equ:rr2}
\end{equation}

\noindent the refracted ray has an angle of $90^{\circ}$. For acrylic with an index of refraction of $1.49$, the critical angle is $42.16^{\circ}$. At incident angles above the critical angle there is no refraction. Instead, the entire ray reflects inside the acrylic. This is called {\bf total internal reflection}. 

The laws of reflection and refraction can be used to examine the passage of light through a plate with plane parallel surfaces. Figure \ref{fig:rr2} below shows an incident ray and the reflected and refracted rays at the boundaries between the air and the acrylic. The light ray emerges from the plate parallel to the original ray but laterally displaced from it.

\end{figure}



Incident ray AB partly (about $5\%$) reflects externally to generate the reflected ray BG. The rest of the incident light refracts to ray BC. At the other end of the plate, ray BC internally reflects to give ray CE and refracts to produce ray CD, the exiting light. Ray CE behaves similarly and yields a refracted ray and an internally reflected ray which in turn gives a refracted and reflected component and so on. Note that because the sides of the plate are parallel, rays AB and CD are parallel, rays BG and EF are parallel, all internal angles are equal to the refraction angle $\varphi '$, and all external angles are equal to the incident angle $\varphi$.

If the sides of the plate are not parallel, the deviation produced by the first refraction is not undone by the second refraction. So the incident rays and exiting rays are not parallel. A $prism$ takes advantage of this fact by inclining two surfaces at an angle $\alpha$ to achieve a desired amount of deviation, $\delta$. Figure \ref{fig:rr3} shows an {\bf equilateral prism}. Here the sides are all inclined at $\alpha=60^{\circ}$ to each other.

Suppose that the laws of reflection and refraction are both followed by light travelling inside the prism. Let lines MM' and PP' be surface normals and let ray AB have incident angle $\varphi_1$. The angle of deviation of the refracted ray BC from the first surface is given by $\beta=\varphi_1-\varphi_1'$. Ray BC is further deviated by angle $\gamma=\varphi_2-\varphi_2'$ when it exits the prism at the second surface to give exit ray CD. The total {\bf deviation} of ray CD from ray AB is

\begin{equation}
\delta=\beta+\gamma=\varphi_1+\varphi_2-\varphi_1'-\varphi_2'
\label{equ:rr3}
\end{equation}

Angle MNP' is $\alpha$ so triangle BCN implies

\begin{equation}
\alpha = \varphi_1'+\varphi_2'
\label{equ:rr4}
\end{equation}

\noindent so

\begin{equation}
\delta = \varphi_1+\varphi_2-\alpha
\label{equ:rr5}
\end{equation}

Angle $\varphi_2$ is determined by the laws of refraction at the entrance and exit of the prism and $\alpha$ is a constant for a given prism. So Equation \ref{equ:rr5} implies that the angle of deviation for a given prism only depends on the incident angle of the ray and the index of refraction of the prism.

Figure \ref{fig:rr4} shows a graph of the expected deviation of an equilateral acrylic prism. The constants for this prism are $\alpha = 60^{\circ}$ and $n' = 1.49$. As the incident angle decreases from $90^{\circ}$, the deviation decreases to a minimum value of $36.3^{\circ}$. This minimum is called the {\bf angle of minimum deviation}, $\delta_m$. At this angle, ray BC is parallel to the base of the prism. There is a relation between this minimum angle of deviation and the constants of the prism, which is

\begin{equation}
n'=\dfrac{\sin^{-1}\left[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha+\delta_m)\right]}{\sin(\frac{1}{2}\alpha)}

As the incident angle decreases still further, the deviation begins to rise again to a maximum at an incident angle of $27.2^{\circ}$. No deviation is possible at angles smaller than this incidence angle because total internal reflection happens at point C. Ray CD vanishes and ray CE exits out of the bottom face of the prism instead.

The previous objects are all composed of straight sides. Instead, consider an object having sides which are curved. Although the laws of refraction and reflection still hold true, the normal line to which they refer is different at each point on the surface. So parallel rays incident on a curved surface will not remain parallel after reflection from a curved mirror as seen in Figure \ref{fig:rr5}. Similarly, parallel rays incident on a curved surface need not remain parallel after passing through an object as seen in Figure \ref{fig:rr5}.

Consider the lens shown in Figure \ref{fig:rr5}. Each side is produced by a spheroid of given radius $R$ and the index of refraction of the lens material is $n_L$. Furthermore, suppose that  the lens is immersed in air. In this case, the {\bf lensmaker's equation} relates the radii of curvature, $R_1$ and $R_2$, of the two lens surfaces and the index of refraction of the lens material to the focal length by the expression

Note that in this construction, the width of the lens is assumed to be negligibly small in comparison to the distance of object being viewed and the image being formed. Also, the standard convention for a biconvex lens must be used, namely that $R_1>0$ and $R_2<0$. Otherwise Equation \ref{equ:rr7} predicts that a symmetric lens will have an infinite focal length.

The focal point can also be determined by measuring the distance to the object observed and the image produced via the {\bf Gaussian lens formula}

\dfrac{1}{f}=\dfrac{1}{i}+\dfrac{1}{o}

\end{marginfigure}

The radius of curvature for a given spherical lens or mirror may not be known in advance. In this case, the geometric construct shown in Figure \ref{fig:rr6} can be used to measure the radius of curvature. On the arc to be measured, draw any two chords AB and CD. Using a compass and straight edge draw the perpendicular bisectors of these two chords EF and GH. From plane geometry, these two bisectors will intersect at the center of curvature of the arc, point $R$. The radius of curvature can then be measured as the distance between $R$ and the optical surface $S$.

The basic experimental apparatus is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rr7}. A cork board is placed on top of a stand for easier access and observation. To examine the law of reflection, a mirror is pinned to the cork board on top of a {\bf mirror worksheet}. This worksheet is supplied with the experiment and extra copies are available as necessary. Examination of the mirror worksheet shows a protractor drawn beside a roughly triangular shape. The triangular shape is the mirror used for this experiment. Note that each side of the triangle is a different type of mirror surface. One surface is a plane mirror, the other a concave mirror, and the third a convex mirror. Individual rays of light are traced by visually observing the alignment of four pins as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rr8}. Two pins trace an incident ray of light and two others trace the corresponding reflected ray. The angle of incidence is selected by placing two pins on the protractor on the mirror worksheet at a particular angle. The reflected ray is found by placing two more pins that visually appear to line up with the reflection of the incident ray pins. The pins are aligned correctly when all four pins appear to line up. A ruler is then used to draw a line along each pair of pins. In this way an incident ray and reflected ray are drawn on the worksheet. The angle of the reflected ray can then be measured with a protractor. The law of reflection can be examined experimentally using this method.

Similarly, the rectangular plate worksheet and acrylic block can be pinned onto the cork board to examine the law of refraction. As with the mirror, pins can be placed at a given angle of incidence. However, instead of sighting through the block by eye, a laser is used so that the entire path of the rays inside the block can be observed. The laser arrangement is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rr9}. Using one pin for reference on the input side, rotate and align the cork board so that the laser passes through the pin and the zero mark. This sets up the input beam. Then, two more pins can be placed on the output side so that they intersect the laser beam exiting from the block. The exiting ray can then be traced back to the exit point C with pencil and ruler as seen in Figure \ref{fig:rr8}. The worksheet has a dotted vertical line passing through the block. This line has two uses. First, the entrance point B is located on this dotted line at the top of the block. Connecting B to C with a line gives a tracing of the ray of light as it passes through the acrylic block. The angle of this line is measured with a protractor to determine the angle of refraction at point B. The second use of the dotted line is for lining up the protractor when measuring the angle of refraction.

Next, the equilateral prism worksheet and acrylic prism can be pinned onto the cork board to investigate prism behaviour. Again, a laser beam can be placed at a particular angle of incidence on the protractor to create a ray going into the prism. The outgoing ray can then be investigated to measure the angle of deviation, find the angle of minimum deviation, or determine when critical internal reflection happens. Lastly, this same examination can be performed with the double concave and double convex lens blocks and lens worksheets.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The law of reflection can be experimentally examined by the behaviour of a flat mirror. Arrange the apparatus as seen in Figure \ref{fig:rr7}. Put the supplied universal mirror onto the mirror worksheet and pin it into place. The protractor on the worksheet is used to set the angle of the two pins specifying the input ray. Since light travels in straight lines, an incident ray with a given angle of incidence can be simulated by placing two pins in a straight line at an angle to the flat mirror. Visually place two other pins so that they appear to line up with the reflection of the first two pins. These two pins represent the reflected ray. Use a straight edge to draw lines through the pins. For at least four different incidence angles, plot the incident ray and the reflected ray. Measure the angle of reflection using a protractor. If the law of reflection is to hold, a graph of $\theta_i$ versus $\theta_r$ should be linear with slope $1$.

\item The behaviour of a light rays on a curved mirror can be explored just as in the case for a flat mirror. Using the mirror template, trace at least six separate incoming rays and determine the point at which the reflected rays converge. This will give a value for the focal length of the curved mirror. For a parabolic mirror, the focal point is located on the axis of symmetry, halfway between the mirror surface and the radius of curvature, which theoretically is $f=R/2$. If the mirror is not precisely parabolic there may be some spherical aberration. Using the geometric construction as in Figure \ref{fig:rr6}, determine the radius of curvature for the mirror and compare with the measured value of $f$. Qualitatively describe the resultant image when an object (say, a pencil or a pen) is placed outside $f$, inside $f$, and at a distance of around $f$ from the surface of the mirror. Explain these results quantitatively.

\item The remainder of this experiment is performed with rays of light from a laser instead of sighting pins, although pins can still be used to record the position of the laser beam. Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rr9}. For the rest of this experiment the laser should be arranged to emit a horizontal beam roughly at or below chest height. Always arrange the laser so that the primary beam is hitting the screen. Be mindful of the position of all the reflections and refractions of the beam. Do {\bf not ever} look into the laser beam or shine it in someone's eyes. Do {\bf not ever} put your eyes at the level of the laser. The best defense is to always keep your eyes above the level of the laser beam. Keep this in mind if something gets dropped and an experimenter has to bend down to pick it up. Remember to look away or keep your eyes closed. Also, remove watches and all articles of jewelry from your hands. Your eyes and the eyes of your fellow experimenters will thank you.

\item The angle of refraction can be examined experimentally by tracing rays of light through a rectangular plate of acrylic as in Figure \ref{fig:rr2}. Place the rectangular acrylic block onto the rectangular plate worksheet and pin it into place so it doesn't move. The protractor on the worksheet is used to set the angle of  the input ray AB. Once ray AB is in place with the laser, look down on the rectangular plate and observe where the light goes. Trace the exit ray from C to D. Use a straight edge to draw lines representing the input and output rays. Light rays travel in a straight line inside the acrylic. So a straight edge can be used to draw a line connecting points B and C. This represents the path of ray BC inside the acrylic block. Use a protractor to measure the angle of refraction of ray BC. Measure the angle of refraction for at least six different angles of incidence.

\item Referring to Figure \ref{fig:rr2}, plot a graph of $\sin\varphi '$ versus $\sin\varphi$ and determine the index of refraction $n'$ from the slope of the graph.

\item The behaviour of rays as they pass through an acrylic equilateral prism can be examined the same way. The protractor on the prism worksheet is used to set the angle of incidence of the input laser beam. The exit ray can then be located in order to trace the laser beam as it passes through the prism. Trace the input rays for at least six incidence angles ranging from $35^{\circ}$ to $65^{\circ}$. As in Figure \ref{fig:rr3}, extend input ray AB and exit ray CD with a straight edge, and measure the angle of deviation, $\delta$, with a protractor.

\item Using the index of refraction for acrylic found in Step 5 above, rewrite Equation \ref{equ:rr5} solely in terms of $\varphi$ and $n'$. Plot a theoretical curve of $\delta$ as a function of $\varphi$ and plot the values of $\delta$ measured in Step 5 with error bars on top of the theoretical curve. Compare the experimental value for the angle of minimum deviation to that found by solving Equation \ref{equ:rr6}.

\item The thin lens equation (Equation \ref{equ:rr7}) may be verified if both $R_1$ and $R_2$ are known and the index of refraction of the lens has already been measured. In order to determine a value for the radii of curvature, trace an image of the acrylic converging lens onto paper and use the geometry of Figure \ref{fig:rr6}. Since a value of $n$ has already been obtained for the material, $f$ can be found from Equation \ref{equ:rr7}. Using the converging lens worksheet and the laser, trace at least six parallel rays through the lens and determine an average value for the focal length $f$. Compare this to the value predicted by the lensmakers equation and comment on your results.

\item Repeat Step 8 for the double concave acrylic lens and worksheet.


\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}

In this experiment one source of error that arises is the alignment of the pins. It is not possible to measure when the pins are all exactly aligned. However, it is possible to say with reasonable confidence that the pins are aligned {\bf plus or minus half a degree}. The error in the pin alignment is then said to be half a degree. Once the pins are in place, other errors also arise. There is an error of half a degree in the procedure of drawing a straight line through the pins. There is also an error of half a degree in the accuracy of the angles as written on the graphical worksheets from distortions during the photocopying process. Furthermore, there will be some inaccuracy in the placement of the mirror and the acrylic rectangle and equilateral prism. Assume that this error is also half a degree.

Lastly, once the rays have been drawn, it is necessary to measure their angles with a protractor. Three sorts of errors happen during this measurement. First, the protractor must be lined up properly, in order to read off the angle. The error in doing this is called the {\bf zero point error}. Secondly, there is some difference between the true angle and the markings of the angle on the protractor. This is called the {\bf calibration error} of the protractor. Third, there is some uncertainty in reading the angle because the angle to be measured will not land exactly on a line of the protractor scale. This is called the {\bf measuring error}. It has been found in practice that for instruments with scales (such as a protractor or ruler), the measuring error is often {\bf half the smallest scale division} on the instrument. For the protractors used here, the smallest scale division is one degree, so the protractor measuring error is taken to be half a degree. It is estimated that each of the other two errors, the calibration error and zero point error, are at most half of a degree.

If there are a number of independent measurements, $x_i$, with random errors $u(x_i)$ in an experiment, any quantity, $f=f(x_1, x_2,...x_n)$, that depends on them will have an associated error given by the following expression

\begin{equation}
u(f) = \sqrt{\sum_i\left|\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\right|^2u(x_i)^2}
\label{equ:rr9}
\end{equation}

\section{{\bf Preparation}}

The student should review the basic concepts of physical optics by reading the theory section in this lab and by reviewing the relevant optics section in your textbook from first year physics or from this course. There is significant terminology used in optics of which the student should have a basic understanding.

\section{{\bf Goals of the Experiment}}

To observe the operation of thin lenses and gain experience with the placement and alignment of optical components. To examine and measure real and virtual images in simple optical systems. To measure the focal lengths of double convex and double concave lenses. To understand and use simple optical instruments like the magnifier and the diopter gauge.

\section{{\bf Theory}}

An understanding of lenses as \textbf{converging} or \textbf{diverging} and a classification of their surfaces as \textbf{concave}, \textbf{convex}, or \textbf{planar} is needed for this experiment. The relationship between object distance, $o$, image distance, $i$, and lens focal length, $f$, is used in several parts of the experiment. The formula relating these quantities is:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{i} + \frac{1}{o} = \frac{1}{f}.
	\label{equ:tlFocalLenthEquation}
\end{equation}

A second formula that is used in parts of this experiment is the \text{magnification} of an image. For an object height, $y_o$, and an image height, $y_i$, the magnification, $m$, is given by
\begin{equation}
	m = \frac{y_i}{y_o} = -\frac{i}{o}.
	\label{equ:tlMagnitudeEquation}
\end{equation}

A significant portion of the experiment involves measuring the \textbf{focal lengths} of different lenses. A knowledge of the properties of \textbf{focal points} for converging and diverging lenses is therefore needed here. The distinction between \textbf{real images} and \textbf{virtual images} and \textbf{real objects} and \textbf{virtual objects} is explored. An understanding of their differences will be helpful. Some parts of the experiment examine the operation of simple optical instruments like the \textbf{magnifier} and the \textbf{telescope}. For more information on all these ideas, it will be helpful to study the relevant optics sections in your textbook before doing the experiment. Some ideas not covered in the textbook are discussed below.

An instrument commonly used to measure the focal lengths of lenses is the \textbf{diopter gauge}. The principle of operation of the diopter gauge is based on the \textbf{lens maker's equation}. Suppose a thin lens immersed in air is made from a material with \textbf{index of refraction}, $n$. One side of the lens has radius of curvature, $R_1$, and the other side has a \textbf{radius of curvature}, $R_2$. The focal length of the lens is given by the lens maker's equation
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right).
	\label{equ:tlLensMakersEquation}
\end{equation}

For lenses that are double convex, $R_1$ is positive and $R_2$ is negative, so Equation~\ref{equ:tlLensMakersEquation} implies that this type of lens has positive focal length. For lenses that are double concave, $R_1$ is negative and $R_2$ is positive, so Equation~\ref{equ:tlLensMakersEquation} implies that this type of lens has negative focal length. If one of the surfaces is flat the radius of curvature will be infinite. The reciprocal is then zero and the lens maker's formula implies that this surface does not contribute anything towards determining the focal length. A lens with both sides flat (a window) has an infinite focal length.

In many optics formulae (including the lens maker's equation), the focal length only appears as a reciprocal. It therefore makes sense to define a unit of reciprocal focal length. The \textbf{power}, $\mathcal{D}$, of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length of the lens in meters. The unit of lens power is called the \textbf{diopter} ($D$). Since converging lenses have positive focal lengths and diverging lenses have negative focal lengths, the power of a lens is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses. For example, a converging lens with a focal length of one meter has a power of one diopter ($1D =$ $1$ $m^{-1}$). A diverging lens with a focal length of $0.2$ meters has a power of $-5.0$ diopters. A flat piece of window glass does not converge or diverge incoming light rays, it has a power of zero diopters. The lens maker's formula can be rewritten in terms of dioptric power to get
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{D} = (n-1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right).
	\label{equ:tlPowerEquation}
\end{equation}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tlConcaveLensLeftAndRight}, imagine a lens, $L$, as being split in half to form a combination of two lenses, $L_{\text{Left}}$ and $L_{\text{Right}}$, each of which is flat on one side. The two lenses, $L_{\text{Left}}$ and $L_{\text{Right}}$, are in contact on their flat sides and touching. Lens $L$ has a radius of curvature $R_1$ on the left and $R_2$ on the right. The power of lens L is given by Equation 4. Lens $L_{\text{Left}}$ has a radius of curvature $R_1$ on the left and $\infty$ on the right. Similarly, Lens $L_{\text{Right}}$ has radius of curvature $\infty$ on the left and $R_2$ on the right. Let the power of lens $L_{\text{Left}}$ be $\mathcal{D}_{\text{Left}}$ and the power of lens $L_{\text{Right}}$ be $\mathcal{D}_{\text{Right}}$. Then by the lens maker's formula the power of each half lens is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{D}_{\text{Left}} = \frac{(n-1)}{R_1}
	\label{equ:tlPowerLeftEquation}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{D}_{\text{Right}} = - \frac{(n-1)}{R_2}.
	\label{equ:tlPowerRightEquation}
\end{equation}

Observe that the sum of Equations~\ref{equ:tlPowerLeftEquation} and~\ref{equ:tlPowerRightEquation} yields Equation~\ref{equ:tlPowerEquation}. This means that \textbf{the power of a lens is equal to the sum of the powers of its two surfaces}. If an instrument could measure the power of a single surface then the focal length of a lens could be measured by adding together the power of each lens surface. This is one of the principles upon which the operation of a diopter gauge is based.

\caption{Diopter gauge.}
\label{fig:tlDiopterGauge}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:tlDiopterGauge} shows a diagram of a diopter gauge measuring one surface of a lens. A diopter gauge measures the power of a single surface by determining the radius of curvature. The gauge is held against the surface of the lens so that it is perpendicular to the surface and the two fixed pins are touching the glass. If it is assumed that the surface is a section from a circle then the amount that the moveable pin is compressed determines the radius of curvature of the surface. If the index of refraction of the material is known, the dioptric power of the surface can be found from Equation~\ref{equ:tlPowerLeftEquation}. The diopter gauges used in this experiment are calibrated for \textbf{crown glass} with an index of refraction of $1.525$. The scales read off the power of the surface directly in diopters when the lens material is crown glass.
	
The procedure for measuring the power of a lens with the diopter gauge is as follows. Determine whether the surface is convex or concave by holding a straight edge against the lens. Do not scratch the surface or leave fingerprints on it. If the surface is convex read from the black inner scale. If the surface is concave read from the red outer scale. A flat surface will read zero on both scales. Hold the gauge perpendicular to the surface so that all three pins touch the surface. The pins are rounded and treated so that they do not scratch the glass. Read the power of the surface in diopters. Repeat the procedure for the other surface. The total power of the lens is sum of the two diopter readings. The focal length is then the inverse of this number in meters.
	
The rules for adding powers of surfaces together to get the total power of a lens are simple. Convex surfaces have positive power, concave surfaces have negative power, and flat surfaces have zero power. The total lens power is the sum of the power of the two surfaces. Examples for various types of lenses are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tlVariousLens}.

Another method useful for determining the focal length of a lens is called the \textbf{displacement method}. Suppose an object and a screen are located a fixed distance, b, apart. The converging lens whose focal length is to be measured is in between. As the lens is moved to different locations between the object and the screen it is found that a real image is focused on the screen only when the lens is in two specific positions. At one position the image is larger than the object and at the other position the image is smaller than the object.

\caption{Positioning of a lens when using the displacement method to calculate focal length.}
\label{fig:tlDisplacementMethodPositions}
\end{figure}

As in Figure~\ref{fig:tlDisplacementMethodPositions}, define, $a$, as the separation between the two positions of the lens. It is a fact that the focal length of the lens can be found once $a$ and $b$ are known. The focal length is given by the formula
\begin{equation}
	f = \frac{b^2-a^2}{4b}
	\label{equ:tlabFocalLenthEquation}
\end{equation}

The smallest possible value a can have is zero. Substituting $a_0 \geq 0$ into Equation~\ref{equ:tlabFocalLenthEquation} shows that the longest focal length that can be measured for a given $b$ is $b/4$. For the optical bench used in this experiment, this limits the measurable focal length to anything below $30$ cm.

An advantage of this method is that it gives accurate results because the distance, $a$, is independent of the thickness of the lens and the position of the lens in the lens holder. Similarly, the distance, $b$, between object and screen can be measured accurately so that offsets of the screen and object can be eliminated. Furthermore, $b$ needs to be measured only once since object and screen remain fixed.
	
A second advantage of this method is that it permits the measurement of sizes and positions of inaccessible objects such as the filament inside a bulb or a virtual image located behind a lens. This will be used in this experiment to measure the position and magnification of a virtual image produced by a lens used as a magnifier. It will also be used in this experiment to measure the position of a virtual image generated by a diverging lens.

Imagine replacing the object in Figure~\ref{fig:tlDisplacementMethodPositions} with some sort of lens system that produces a virtual image, such as a concave lens. Apply the displacement method with a lens of known focal length to get a value for $a$. Solving Equation~\ref{equ:tlabFocalLenthEquation} for $b$ then gives a value for the position of the virtual image.

The size of the virtual image can also be measured. Suppose the virtual image has size, y. Let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be the sizes of the real image on the screen for the two possible positions of the lens. Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be the magnifications at the two lens positions. It is a fact that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are reciprocals. So

\begin{equation}
	1 = M_1 M_2 = \left(- \frac{y_1}{y} \right) \left(- \frac{y_2}{y} \right) = \frac{y_1 y_2}{y^2}
	\label{equ:tlImageSize}
\end{equation}

Therefore, the virtual image size, y, is
\begin{equation}
	y = \sqrt{y_1 y_2}
	\label{equ:tlVirtualImageSizeEquation}
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{equ:tlVirtualImageSizeEquation} gives the size of the image being tested from the measured sizes of the images on the screen.

Figure~\ref{fig:tlOpticalBench} shows the experimental layout. Optical components such as lenses, screens and test objects can be placed into holders that slide along on an optical bench. The optical bench ensures that all the components are aligned correctly. The side of the optical bench has a scale that is used to measure or set the distances between various components. A lighted test object is used to make image location straightforward.

Four converging lenses ranging in focal lengths from short (L$1$), through medium (L$2$ and L$3$), to long (L$4$), and one diverging lens (L$5$) are supplied for use in the experiment.

\section{{\bf Experimental Procedure}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The laboratory lights should be dimmed for the duration of this experiment. It is possible to determine the focal length of converging lenses in several ways. This experiment begins by examining some different methods for measuring focal lengths of converging lenses. First, determine the focal lengths of lenses L$1$, L$2$, L$3$, and L$4$ by the method of placing an object at infinity. For a converging lens, when an object is at infinity the image lies at the focal point with zero size. As an approximation to an object at infinity, use a lighted object on the other side of the laboratory. Point the optical bench at the lighted object. The lens to be measured is placed into a holder on the optical bench. Using the screen, locate the position of the real image and thereby the focal length. After these measurements it may be useful to place the lenses on a labelled sheet of paper with the relevant symbols L$1$ through L$5$ so that the lenses do not get mixed up. L$1$ is the shortest focal length converging lens and L$4$ the longest, with L$2$ and L$3$ intermediate. L$5$ is the diverging lens.
	\item Determine the focal lengths of lenses L$1$, L$2$, L$3$, L$4$, and L$5$ with the diopter gauge.
	\item Keep the lighted object at a fixed location on the optical bench. Place lens L$1$ in a holder between the object and the screen. Adjust the position of lens L$1$ and the screen until the real image observed on the screen is the same size as the object. At this position the magnification of the image is $-1.0$. Use this fact to determine the focal length of L$1$.
	\item Use the displacement method to measure the focal length of lens L$2$. Place the screen at a scale reading of $0$ on the optical bench and the lighted object at a scale reading of $115$ on the optical bench. With lens L$2$ between the object and the screen locate the two positions where a real image is formed on the screen. The focal length of L$2$ is then found from Equation~\ref{equ:tlabFocalLenthEquation}. At first glance the value for $b$ must be $115$. However, the screen and object are offset somewhat from the index indicators on the side of the optical bench. To get a better value for $b$ place a meter stick between the screen and object so that it is touching both. The difference between the scale reading on the optical bench and $100.0$ cm then gives the exact offset and hence a more accurate value for $b$. Note that the thickness of the glass in front of the lighted test object is $0.3$ cm. To get an even more accurate value for $b$ use the value $100.3$ cm instead of $100.0$ cm when computing the offset.
	\item The object distance, $o$, and image distance, $i$, are related by Equation~\ref{equ:tlFocalLenthEquation}. For at least five different object distances, measure the image distance for the real image produced by lens L$3$ on the screen. The focal length of L$3$ can be found by plotting a graph of $1/i$ versus $1/o$.
	\item Having measured the focal lengths of some converging lenses by several different methods we now turn our attention to measuring the focal length of a diverging lens using two different methods. Place the screen at a scale reading of zero on the optical bench and the lighted object at a scale reading of $115$ on the optical bench. Put lens L$5$ in a lens holder and position it $10$ to $20$ cm from the lighted object. A glance into L$5$ shows a virtual image at a position somewhere behind lens L$5$ that is smaller than the object.

\label{fig:tlConcaveFocalLength1}
\end{figure}
	
Select L$2$ as a lens with known focal length, $f$, and place it on the optical bench between L$5$ and the screen. Use the displacement method to find a value for $b$. This gives a value for the distance of the virtual image, $i$, from lens L$5$. Equation 1 can then be used to find the focal length of L$5$ since the object distance, $o$, between the lighted test object and L$5$ is readily measured. Figure ~\ref{fig:tlConcaveFocalLength1} illustrates some of the differences between a real image and a virtual image. Light rays always converge to a real image and diverge away from a virtual image.
	\item The focal length of a diverging lens can also be found by measuring how far a real image shifts when the diverging lens is added to the system. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tlConcaveFocalLength1}, suppose a converging lens like L$1$ is used to form a real image on a screen at point $R$. When diverging lens L$5$ is placed between L$1$ and the screen, the real image is no longer focused on the screen. The focal point has moved further away so that a real image appears on a screen at point $S$ instead. Lens L$5$ diverges the light rays so they meet at a point further away.
	
This shift in focal length can be used to obtain a value for the focal length of L$5$. When L$5$ is inserted the real image at $R$ disappears. Instead, lens L$5$ generates a real image at the new position $S$ from the \textbf{virtual} object at point $R$. The image distance is the distance from L$5$ to $S$ (it is positive). The object distance is the distance from L$5$ to $R$ (it is negative). Equation~\ref{equ:tlFocalLenthEquation} can be used to determine the focal length of L$5$.

Figure~\ref{fig:tlConcaveFocalLength2} illustrates one of the differences between a real object and a virtual object. The light rays emitted from a real object are always \textbf{diverging}. The light rays emitted from a virtual object are always converging. Determine the focal length of L$5$ by this method. Best results are obtained when L$1$ is $12$ cm away from the lighted object.

\section{{\bf STUDENT CHOICE SECTION}}

\textbf{To complete this lab, you now have the choice of carrying out either part $8$ or part $9$ of this lab, based on your own interests. Part $8$ allows you to investigate the design and operation of magnifying glasses and microscopes, while part $9$ focusses on the equivalent properties of telescopes. The second half of part $9$ also consists of $2$ choices.  Therefore, a complete version of this lab includes procedure parts $1$ through $7$, plus ($8$a and $8$b) OR ($9$a and $9$b) OR ($9$a and $9$c).}

	\item \textbf{Magnifying Glass and Microscopes}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
		\item A magnifying glass is used to make enlarged virtual images. The size and position of these virtual images can be measured by applying the displacement method with a lens of known focal length. Use L$1$ as a magnifying glass. Apply the displacement method with L$3$ as the known focal length lens. Place the screen at scale reading $0$ on the optical bench and the lighted test object at scale reading $115$ on the optical bench. Use L$1$ as a magnifying glass on the test object. This means that lens L$1$ should be placed less than one focal length away from the lighted object. Look through the lens to verify that a magnified virtual image is indeed visible. Place lens L$3$ between the screen and lens L$1$. Determine a value for '$a$' from the two positions of L$3$ that produce a real image on the screen. Use the known focal length of L$3$ to compute $b$ and therefore find the location of the virtual image. Measure the sizes of the two images on the screen and apply Equation~\ref{equ:tlVirtualImageSizeEquation} to find the size of the virtual image. The size and position of the virtual image can be independently computed (using Equations~\ref{equ:tlFocalLenthEquation} and ~\ref{equ:tlMagnitudeEquation}) by using the known focal length of L$1$ and the object distance. The size and position of the virtual image obtained by these two methods can be compared. If there is difficulty getting two different real images with L$3$, move L$1$ closer to the test object.
		\item Using lenses L$1$ through L$5$ as required, construct a compound microscope. Locate the positions of the lenses that produce the best image. Draw a diagram of your instrument together with the positions and focal points of each lens.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{Telescopes}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
		\item Using lenses L$1$ through L$5$, construct a Keplerian refracting telescope. This telescope uses a converging \textbf{objective} and a converging \textbf{eyepiece}. The objective lens is the lens nearest the object being viewed. The eyepiece lens is the lens nearest the eye. The eyepiece position determines the focus of the telescope. People who wear eyeglasses may want to check where the eyepiece needs to be when viewing with and without their glasses. Find the positions of the lenses in your telescope that create the best image of a lighted object located on the other side of the laboratory. Also determine the position of the real image created by the objective lens. Draw a diagram of the constructed telescope. Show the distance between the two lenses. Also include the focal point of each lens as measured in previous steps and the location of the real image generated by the objective.
		\item The Kepler retractor produces an inverted image. Placing an extra converging lens between objective and eyepiece inverts the image. This is called the \textbf{erector} lens. In addition, the position of the erector can be used to adjust the magnification of the telescope. Construct a working Kepler telescope with an erecting lens and draw a diagram of the telescope. Include positions and focal lengths of each lens. It may be that the telescope will not fit onto the optical bench so the eyepiece lens may have to be hand held. Check that the position of the erector determines the magnification and note the range of travel of the erector that still gives a usable image.
		\item Using lenses L1 through L5, construct a a \textbf{Galilean refracting telescope}. A Galilean retractor uses a converging objective and a diverging eyepiece. Find the positions of the lenses in your telescope that create the best image of a lighted object located on the other side of the laboratory. Also determine the position of the real image created by the objective lens. Draw a diagram of the constructed telescope. Show the distance between the two lenses. Also include the focal point of each lens as measured in previous steps and the location of the real image generated by the objective.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{{\bf Error Analysis Hints}}

One source of error in this experiment comes from uncertainties in positioning the lenses. The optical bench permits reasonably accurate positioning of lenses along the bench. However, the height at which the lenses are placed is not precisely adjustable. Also, the orientation of the lenses should be perpendicular to the optical bench and parallel to the lighted object. Adjustments in these directions are not available on the apparatus except by rough positioning of the lens inside the lens holder.

A second source of error in this experiment is due to aberrations in the lenses themselves. A full discussion of the deviations of physical glass lenses from the theoretical ideal is beyond the level of this course. However, it can easily be seen that the quality of images at the edges is quite different from image quality at the center. This suggests that the lenses used in this experiment have different properties at their edges than at their centers. One reason for this difference is that the lenses have different thickness's at the edge and at the center. Many of the optics formulas used in this experiment assume that the lenses are thin to partly remove this difficulty.
	
Each lens holder has an index marker on the side that is used to measure the position of the item in the holder (usually a lens, lighted object, or screen). There will be an offset between the true position of the object in the holder and the reading on the scale. Lastly, there is the issue of determining when an image is properly in focus. This is determined by the angular resolution of the human eye and varies somewhat from person to person. The distortions of the real images from lens aberrations also contributes to the uncertainty in establishing the location of a real image. The edges of the image actually focus at a slightly different location from the center of a real image.
	
Since many of these errors are not subject to the direct control and measurement of the experimenter, no error analysis will be used in this experiment.

\section{{\bf Theory}}

\'{E}tienne L. Malus discovered the \textbf{polarization} of light by absorption in 1808 by accident when he was playing with a crystal of Iceland Spar in his apartment in Paris. He looked at reflections of the sun in a window of the Luxembourg Palace across the street and noticed how the intensity varied when he rotated the crystal (the image of the sun is partially polarized upon reflection). He followed this with further experiments and ultimately obtained \textbf{Malus' law}, which predicts the intensity of the light transmitted through a polarizer. He also discovered \textbf{double refraction} in crystals, or \textbf{birefringence}, later in $1810$. 

\textbf{Natural light}, or \textbf{unpolarized light}, consists of a large mixture of waves vibrating in all directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Each wave is called a \textbf{wavetrain}. These wavetrains do not last for very long and new wavetrains are constantly emitted from the light source. Thus, the overall polarization is constantly changing in an erratic manner. \textbf{Polarized light} occurs when the vibration of the electric field is confined to one plane. Monochromatic light is considered to have an infinite wavetrain, and a perfectly monochromatic plane wave is always polarized. In general, however, any form of light is neither completely unpolarized nor completely polarized. More often, the electric field vector varies in a way that is not totally regular or totally irregular. This is referred to as \textbf{partial polarization}.
 
Light is an electromagnetic wave. Its fundamental characteristics can be described in terms of the electric field intensity, which can take the form
\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}_t = \vec{E}_0 \left[\hat{i} \cos(kz-\omega t) + \hat{j} \sin(kz - \omega t) \right],
	\label{equ:mlGenralizedEMWave}
\end{equation}

where $E_t$ is the transmitted electric field intensity, and $E_0$ is the initial electric field intensity. The \textbf{angular frequency}, $\omega$, and \textbf{wave number}, $k$, are related to the \textbf{frequency}, $f$, and \textbf{wavelength}, $\lambda$, by
\begin{equation}
	\omega = 2 \pi f
	\label{equ:mlAngularFrequencyDef}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
	\label{equ:mlWaveNumberDef}
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{equ:mlGenralizedEMWave} implies that light is a transverse wave because its oscillations occur perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the light. The electric field vector, $\mathbf{E_t}$, is propagating in the $z$-direction, and the electric field is oscillating in the $x$ and $y$ directions (i.e. $E_t = (E_x,E_y)$). When the direction and/or the magnitude of these oscillations of $x$ and $y$ are restrained in some way, then the light wave is said to be polarized. Since the phase constants can be picked arbitrarily for one vector, it is easiest to choose it equal to zero for the $x$-component, $E_x$. Therefore, the total electric field strength perpendicular to the direction of travel is given by
\begin{equation}
	E_x = E_{0,x} \cos(kz - \omega t),
	\label{equ:mlEFieldXComp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	E_y = E_{0,y} \cos(kz - \omega t + \delta),
	\label{equ:mlEFieldYComp}
\end{equation}

where $\delta$ is the \textbf{phase difference}. Equation~\ref{equ:mlEFieldXComp} and Equation~\ref{equ:mlEFieldYComp} are expressions for the curve made by the tip of the electric field vector, $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$. It can be shown that this curve is, in general, an ellipse, when the dependency on time and position is removed. Expanding the expressions for $E_y$ and $E_x$ yields
\begin{equation}
	\frac{E_y}{E_{0,y}} - \frac{E_x}{E_{0,x}} \cos(\delta) = - \sin(kz - \omega t) \sin(\delta).
	\label{equ:mlPhaseSeperatedEquation}
\end{equation}

Solving for $\sin(kz-\omega t)$ in Equation~\ref{equ:mlEFieldXComp} gives
\begin{equation}
	\sin(kz - \omega t) = \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{E_x}{E_{0,x}} \right)^2}.
	\label{equ:mlSolvingForSine}
\end{equation}

Substituting Equation~\ref{equ:mlSolvingForSine} into Equation~\ref{equ:mlPhaseSeperatedEquation} and squaring gives
\begin{equation}
	\left( \frac{E_y}{E_{0,y}} - \frac{E_x}{E_{0,x}} \cos(\delta) \right)^2 = \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{E_x}{E_{0,x}} \right)^2 \right] \sin^2(\delta).
	\label{equ:mlSubAndSquare}
\end{equation}

Expanding out Equation~\ref{equ:mlSubAndSquare} produces the result
\begin{equation}
	\left( \frac{E_y}{E_{y,0}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{E_x}{E_{x,0}} \right)^2 - 2 \left( \frac{E_y}{E_{y,0}} \right)\left( \frac{E_x}{E_{x,0}} \right) \cos(\delta) = \sin^2(\delta)
	\label{equ:mlEllipticalEquation}
\end{equation}

This is an equation for an ellipse making an angle, $\theta$, with the $(E_x, E_y)$ coordinate system such that
\begin{equation}
	\tan(2\theta) = \frac{2E_{0,x}E_{0,y}\cos(\delta)}{E^2_{0,x} - E^2_{0,y}}.
	\label{equ:mlTan2Theta}
\end{equation}

This ellipse is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbEllipticallyPolarizedRotation}. 

	From Equation~\ref{equ:mlEllipticalEquation}, it is seen that the general form of polarization is elliptical. Special cases of \textbf{elliptically polarized light} are \textbf{linearly polarized light} and \textbf{circularly polarized light}. The electric field vector, $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$, completes one full cycle (either an ellipse, circle or a line) as the wave progresses forward by one wavelength.

\end{figure}

	For linearly polarized light, the two beams are perfectly in, or out of, phase. If $E_x$ is zero, then the beam is vertically polarized and if $E_y$ is zero, the beam is horizontally polarized. However, if $E_x$ is equal to $E_y$, then the beam is linearly polarized at an angle of $45$ degrees. More generally, if the phase difference, $\delta$, is zero or an integral multiple of $\pm 2 \pi$, the waves are said to be in phase, and the electric field can be represented by
\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}_{xy} = (\hat{i} E_{0,x} + \hat{j} E_{0,y}) \cos(kz- \omega t).
\end{equation}

This wave has a fixed amplitude of $(\hat{i} E_{0,x} + \hat{j} E_{0,y})$, and is linearly polarized. On the other hand, if $\delta$ is an odd integer multiple of $\pm \pi$, the electric field can be represented by
\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}_{xy} = (\hat{i} E_{0,x} - \hat{j} E_{0,y}) \cos(kz- \omega t). 
\end{equation}

This wave is also linearly polarized, but the plane of vibration is rotated. In all cases of linear polarization, the oscillation is confined to a plane, and the electric field vector goes through one complete cycle as the wave progresses along the $z$-axis through one full wavelength. The electric field vector traces out a line, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbLinearlyPolarizedRotation}.

Circularly polarized light occurs when both waves have equal amplitudes $(E_{0,x} = E_{0,y} = E_0)$ and their phase difference is $\delta = -\pi/2+2m\pi$, where $m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...$. Thus, the wave is given by
\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}_t = E_0 \left[\hat{i} \cos(kz-\omega t) + \hat{j} \sin(kz - \omega t) \right].
\end{equation}

The direction of $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$ is not restricted to a single plane and is time varying. However, the magnitude remains constant and the electric field vector rotates clockwise. This is known as \textbf{right-circularly polarized light}. Again, the $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$ vector makes one complete cycle as the wave moves forward through one full wavelength. On the other hand, if the phase difference is given by $\delta  = \pi/2+2m\pi$, then the wave has the form
\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}_t = E_0 \left[\hat{i} \cos(kz-\omega t) - \hat{j} \sin(kz - \omega t) \right].
\end{equation}

The electric field vector in this case rotates counter-clockwise. This is known as \textbf{left-circularly polarized light}. In both of these cases $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$ traces out a circle like Figure~\ref{fig:mlbCircularlyPolarizedRotation}.

Four main methods of producing polarized light are \textbf{scattering}, \textbf{reflection}, \textbf{dichroism} (absorption), and \textbf{birefringence}. Scattering occurs when light is absorbed and re-radiated by small particles. Scattered light is partially linearly polarized in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the source. It reaches a maximum in a direction at $90^{\circ}$ to the source.  For example, if the sky is examined with a piece of Polaroid, it would be seen that the sky near the Sun and $180^{\circ}$ away from the sun is unpolarized. However, the sky that is $90^{\circ}$ away from the sun is partially polarized. The atmosphere also scatters blue light much more strongly than red light. In the absence of the atmosphere, no light would be scattered and the sky would appear dark. Polarization by scattering is highly dependent on wavelength and on the size of the scattering particles. 

Polarization by reflection occurs when unpolarized light is incident on a boundary between two dielectric surfaces (like air and glass). The reflected and transmitted components will be partially linearly polarized. So, reflections of the sun in glass, pavement, or water are highly polarized. Depending on the height of the sun, the reflections can be almost completely horizontally polarized. Polaroid sunglasses take advantage of this polarization of reflected sunlight. Sunglasses are actually polarizing filters with their transmission axes oriented vertically so they can block the light being reflected by surfaces.

The two phenomena to be examined in this lab are polarization by dichroism and birefringence. Dichroism occurs because certain naturally occurring crystalline materials have transmittance properties which depend on the polarization state of light. For example, light which is linearly polarized in a certain direction is absorbed more than the light perpendicular to it. The resultant light is partially polarized. If the dichroism is large enough, then the resultant light may be nearly perfectly linearly polarized. 
	
Birefringence occurs because certain crystalline substances have a refractive index which depends on the state of polarization. This is also known as \textbf{double refraction}. Unpolarized light that enters a birefringent crystal is split into two linearly polarized beams which are refracted by different amounts. One naturally birefringent substance is calcite, or calcium carbonate (CaCO$_3$). A famous form of crystalline calcite is \textbf{Icelandic feldspar}, which is generally used to demonstrate birefringence. The large birefringence shown by calcite arises from the fact that the carbonate (CO$_3$) groups are all in planes perpendicular to the \textbf{optical axis}.
	
Dichroism is usually demonstrated using a \textbf{polarizer} and an \textbf{analyzer}. A polarizer is any material that only allows light with a specific angle of vibration to pass through. This angle of vibration is known as the \textbf{transmission axis} of the polarizer. An analyzer is essentially a second identical polarizer, whose transmission axis is vertical. If two polarizers, or in this case a polarizer and an analyzer, are set up in series so that their transmission axes are parallel, then light passes through both, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbParallelPolarizer}. However, if the axes are set 90 degrees apart (crossed polarizers), the polarized light from the first will be extinguished by the second, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbPerpendicularPolarizer}. As the angle is rotated from $0$ to $90$ degrees, the amount of light that is transmitted decreases. This is because only the component of the optical field parallel to the transmission axis passes through.

The most common method of producing polarized light is to use \textbf{Polaroid material}. It was invented by Edwin H. Land, who founded the Polaroid Corporation in $1948$, and is made from chains of organic molecules, called \textbf{herapathite} or \textbf{quinine sulfate periodide}, imbedded in plastic. The discovery of these molecules came about in a rather interesting way. In Bristol, England, a pupil of William Bird Herapath found that, when a drop of iodine is added to the urine of a dog that was fed quinine, small green crystals formed. Herapath looked at the crystals under a microscope and discovered that in some places they were light when they overlapped and in other places they were dark when the overlapped. He realized that they had come across a new polarizing material, now known as herapathite. The light that is transmitted by the herapathite is linearly polarized perpendicular to the direction of the chains of molecules. Actual Polaroid material is not $100 \%$ efficient at transmitting light even along its \textbf{transmission axis}, some fraction is always absorbed. Generally, most polarizers have an efficiency of about $40 \%$, but some can get as high as $95 \%$.

In calculating the effect of a dichroic polarizer on an incident light beam, it can be shown that any linearly polarized vibration, or electric field, can be resolved into two components. One is parallel to the transmission axis and the other at right angles to it, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbTransmissionAxis}. Only the light parallel to the transmission axis will pass. If the angle between the electric field vector, $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$, and the transmission axis is $q$, then the component passed through is 
\begin{equation}
	E_t = E_{xy} \cos(\theta),
	\label{equ:mlEtExyRelation}
\end{equation}

where $E_t$ is the transmitted part of the initial electric field, $E_{xy}$.

\end{figure}

The \textbf{intensity} of light is what is measured by optical instruments such as eyes or photodetectors. It is known that the intensity is related to the electric field by the formula
\begin{equation}
	I = \frac{c \epsilon_0}{2} E^2_{xy},
	\label{equ:mlIntensityEquation}
\end{equation}

where $c$ is the speed of light and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. So, it is seen that $I$ is proportional to $\mathbf{E_{xy}}^2$. By substituting Equation~\ref{equ:mlIntensityEquation} into Equation~\ref{equ:mlEtExyRelation}, the relationship between intensity and the angle is found to be
\begin{equation}
	I_t = I_0 \cos^2(\theta),
	\label{equ:mlIntensityFunctionOfAngle}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	I_0 = \frac{c\epsilon_0}{2} E^2_{xy}.
	\label{equ:mlbI0Def}
\end{equation}

$I_t$ is the transmitted intensity and $I_0$ is the initial intensity of the light. Equation~\ref{equ:mlIntensityFunctionOfAngle} is known as \textbf{Malus' law}, which states that the transmitted intensity, It, of light with initial intensity, $I_0$, varies as the square of the cosine of the angle between the two planes of transmission of successive polarizers. When the polarizers are parallel, as in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbParallelPolarizer}, then $\theta=0^{\circ}$ and Malus law predicts that all of the light is passed through as expected. When the polarizers are perpendicular, $\theta=90^{\circ}$ and Malus law predicts that none of the light passed through, again as expected.

However, most real polarizers do not transmit $100\%$ of the light even when the polarization axis of the light is parallel to the transmission axis of the polarizer. For real polarizers, a correction is made to account for the absorbed light. Here, Malus law takes the form
\begin{equation}
	I_t = \alpha I_0 \cos^2(\theta)
\end{equation}

where a is the \textbf{transmission coefficient} of the polarizer.

Usually, Malus' Law is tested using the experimental setup seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbExperimentalSetup}. At first, the natural light has wavetrains going in all different directions. Only light parallel to the transmission axis of the polarizer, at an angle, $\theta$, to the vertical axis, will get though. Then, the light goes through the analyzer, or the second polarizer, which only lets light through that is parallel to its transmission axis, which is vertical. The remaining light then reaches the detector oscillating only in the vertical direction.

The phenomena of birefringence is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbRefractionAngles}. A ray of light that passes through a birefringent is refracted by two different amounts because there are two refractive indices in the crystal. The E beam in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbRefractionAngles} is refracted at an angle of $\theta_E$ to the normal. The O beam is refracted at an angle $\theta_O$ to the normal. The \textbf{optical axis} is the direction within the crystal where there is no double refraction. The \textbf{ordinary index}, $n_o$, is defined to have its electric field vector, $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$, perpendicular to the optical axis. On the other hand, the \textbf{extra-ordinary index}, $n_e$, is defined to have its electric field vector, $\mathbf{E_{xy}}$, parallel to the optical axis.

Crystals with two indices of refraction will be strongly absorbing for one polarization direction and transparent for the other. Therefore, birefringent materials are in fact dichroic, and they consequently act as a linear polarizer. Icelandic feldspar is used to demonstrate the phenomenon of birefringence. Feldspar is a doubly refracting, or birefringent, substance that separates light into two components. The two components have different velocities in the crystal. When the two beams of light emerge from the feldspar, they re-combine. Since one beam travels faster than the other, the two are generally out of phase with one another. The extent to which the two components are out of phase depends on the nature of the birefringent substance, its thickness, the wavelength of the incident light, and the orientation of the crystal.
	
Malus' Law can be tested by using a polarizer-analyzer pair to vary the intensity of the light that is transmitted. A \textbf{photodetector} is used in this experiment to measure the light intensity. The photodetector is calibrated to generate a voltage proportional to the light intensity. A multimeter is used to read the amount of voltage that the photodetector generates. The SI unit of light intensity is \textbf{Lux}. The photodetector has three settings to convert light intensity, in Lux, into volts. Here, the $1$ mV = $1$ Lux setting on the detector should be used because the voltage that is measured is quite small. The angle of the polarizer and analyzer can be found simply from the scale on the device. 

One objective of this experiment is to determine the polarization of a laser and of white light. To find the polarization angle of each light source, only one polarizer and a detector is needed as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbStep3Setup}. By changing the angle of the polarizer, the amount of light being transmitted will change.  The amount of change is determined by the polarization of the incoming light. The polarization angle is the angle at which the most light is transmitted. By knowing this angle, Malus' Law can be tested by setting up the apparatus with two polarizers, as in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbStep5Setup}. By setting the polarizer to the experimental polarization angle found for the light source, and by changing the angle of the analyzer, a set of data points will be obtained. Using this data, a graph of intensity, $I$, versus $\cos^2(q)$ will give a linear plot, if Malus' Law holds. The slope can be used to find the value of the transmission coefficient, $a$. The only difference in finding the polarization angle and the transmission coefficient for the light bulb is that a lens is used to focus the light onto the polarizers and detector.

\section{{\bf Experimental Procedure}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first step is to measure the background light in the room. Connect the digital detector to the multimeter. Set the multimeter to the mV setting and the detector to the $0.1$ mV = $1$ Lux setting. Place the detector at one end of the optical bench, where it should remain for the duration of the experiment. Turn on the multimeter and the detector. Record a value for the reading in the room. Try to make sure that the light does not change drastically during the experiment. To get a more accurate reading, take measurements of the background light periodically throughout the lab. The less background light in the room, the more accurate the measurements will be.
	\item Next, measure the intensity of the laser by itself, without an intervening polarizer, to get a value for the initial intensity, $I_0$. For best results, the laser should be allowed to warm up for at least $10$ minutes first. Otherwise, temperature fluctuations inside the laser tube will change its properties enough that the output intensity varies noticeably.
	\item  The polarizer material could have been rotated inside its holder at some time in the past. So the polarizer and analyzer likely have transmission axes that do not directly correspond to each other or to the angular scales on their holders. So a \textbf{correction}, $\theta_0$, is needed for each polarizer and analyzer. To find the correction, use the experimental arrangement shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbStep3Setup}. Make sure the laser hits the detector approximately in the center. Start the polarizer at 0 degrees and then rotate it until a maximum voltage is seen on the multimeter. Record the angle of maximum voltage. This is the angle correction, $q_0$, for that specific polarizer and is also its transmission axis. Repeat this for the other polarizer, and label one as the polarizer and one as the analyzer so that they are not mixed up. As with all other optical components, never touch the polarizing material with your fingers.

	\item Examine the laser to see if it is fully or partially linearly polarized, or non-polarized. A fully polarized light source would be completely extinguished when passing through a polarizer that is perpendicular to the axis of polarization of the light source. A partially polarized light source would decrease in intensity somewhat, but not be fully extinguished. Non-polarized light would not change intensity at all. To measure this, use one polarizer, as in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbStep3Setup}. For at least $36$ different polarizer angles, $\theta$, from $0$ through $360$ degrees, record the light intensity. The \textbf{corrected angle}, $\theta-\theta_0$, then gives the intensity with respect to the transmission axis of the polarizer.
	\item Malus law can then be tested with two polarizers. Set the apparatus up as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbStep5Setup}. The angle of the polarizer should be set to the angle of maximum output, which is the $q_0$ that was determined for that polarizer. Take at least $36$ measurements of the intensity while varying the angle of the analyzer through $360$ degrees. A plot of intensity versus $\cos^2(\theta-\theta_0)$, where $\theta_0$ is the correction angle of the analyzer, should yield a straight line if Malus law is obeyed.

	\item Place the light bulb securely in a lens holder and connect it to the power supply as in Figure ~\ref{fig:mlbStep7Setup}. Make sure the voltage knob is turned fully counter-clockwise, and the current knob is turned fully clockwise. Turn on the power supply, and give the light bulb full voltage. The light bulb changes brightness as it warms up so it also needs a few minutes to stabilize. It also needs a constant current to maintain the same brightness. Make note of the current on the power supply, and check from time to time to see if the current has changed. If it does change, then adjust it back to its original value with the current knob. Now, take the lens, and focus the light on the center of the detector. Measure the initial intensity, $I_0$, of the light bulb.
	\item Examine the light bulb to see if it is fully or partially linearly polarized, or non-polarized. Remember that light passing through an interface between air and glass emerges partially polarized, with the degree of polarization being dependent upon the angle of the light ray. As with the laser, use one polarizer as in Figure ~\ref{fig:mlbStep3Setup}. For at least 36 different polarizer angles, $\theta$, from $0$ through $360$ degrees, record the light intensity.

	\item Malus Law can be tested using a light bulb as the source. Set up the apparatus as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mlbStep7Setup}. The angle of the polarizer should be set to the angle of maximum light output from the bulb. Then insert and adjust the analyzer for maximum output once more. The angle of maximum output for the analyzer is the correction angle, $\theta_0$, for the analyzer and light bulb. Take at least $36$ measurements of the intensity while varying the angle of the analyzer through $360$ degrees. A plot of intensity versus $\cos^2(\theta-\theta_0)$, where $\theta_0$ is the correction angle of the analyzer, should yield a straight line if Malus law is obeyed.
	\item Place the feldspar crystal over the letter in Figure 12. Observe what happens when the feldspar is rotated.
	\item Hold a polarizer over the feldspar (which is still over the letter). Rotate the polarizer and observe what happens to the letter.
\end{enumerate}

\section{{\bf Error Analysis}}

For Malus' Law to hold, it must be assumed that the transmitted light is completely linearly polarized. However, the polarizers that are being used in this lab are not $100\%$ efficient. This means that, when the polarization axis of the light source is parallel to the transmission axis of the polarizer, not all of the light will get through. In a sense, the polarizer resists light flow. This is why Equation 19 is used. The transmission coefficient, a, is a correction constant to account for this resistance. Each polarizer has a different transmission axis. Corrected values of the angle are needed for proper results. To give corrected values of the angle, set the transmission axis of the polarizer to zero. Then, correct each measured angle by subtracting the transmission axis from the angle that is measured. If this number is a negative number, add $360$ degrees to get a number between $0$ and $360$ degrees. Another systematic error in the lab is the background light. If this value is fairly large, then it should be accounted for by subtracting it from all the values of intensity that is measured in this lab. So, it is a good idea to have the room as dark as possible, so that the background light is negligible.
	The error in the $\cos^2(\theta)$ term can be found by standard error propagation from the error in the angle. The angle and its uncertainty must be in radians, not degrees. The error in measuring the voltage is the instrument error of the Fluke meter shown on the bottom of the instrument. The error in the photodetector is $\pm 5\%+0.1$ mV. The uncertainty for measuring the angle of the polarizer and analyzer is half the smallest division on the protractor.

\section{Purpose}
To use and understand the Michelson interferometer. To use the interferometer to measure the wavelength of laser light. To use the interferometer to measure the index of refraction of air. To investigate how changes in pressure affect the index of refraction of air.


\section{Theory}
In 1887, Albert Michelson (1852-1931) built his interferometer originally to investigate the existence of "ether", which was believed to permeate all space. It was the belief of many physicists at the time that ether was the medium through which light propagated, much like sound waves through air. The results of the famous Michelson-Morley experiment supported the idea that there is no stationary medium through which light propagates, which later formed the basis of Einstein's theory of relativity. The interferometer was later used to measure the wavelengths of atomic spectral lines with high precision, as well as displacements in terms of wavelengths of light. This enabled scientists to develop high precision length standards as well as improved methods for calibrating length measuring instruments. The interferometer can also be used to determine the {\bf index of refraction} of transparent materials.

In this experiment, you will use a Michelson interferometer to determine the wavelength of laser light, as well as to investigate the index of refraction of air and how it is affected by changes in pressure. Figure \ref{fig:mi1} is a diagram of the apparatus, the Pasco model OS-9255A Precision interferometer.

\label{fig:mi1}
\end{figure}

A simplified diagram of the Michelson interferometer is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mi2}. Light from a monochromatic source passes through the beam splitter, producing two perpendicular beams of equal intensity. The two beams then reflect off of two separate mirrors which are deliberately located at different distances from the beam splitter. The mirrors are aligned in such a way that the beam is reflected straight back along the incoming path. When the beams recombine at the beam splitter, they will {\bf interfere} with each other.  Whether the interference will be {\bf constructive} or {\bf destructive} depends on the relative phase of each of the combining light beams. This is determined by the path length difference, 2d. With constructive interference, the wave amplitudes add in such a way to produce a maximum intensity beam striking the screen. The condition for maximum constructive interference is

\begin{equation}
2d=m\lambda
\label{equ:mi1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where m is an integer and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incoming light. When the path length difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength, the recombining light beams will be in phase since both light beams originated from the same source. The resulting amplitude of the combined beam is then the sum of the amplitudes of each beam. 

With destructive interference, the phases of the light beams are such that the recombining beams cancel each other out.  The condition for maximum destructive interference is

\begin{equation}
2d=\left(m+\dfrac{1}{2}\right)\lambda
\label{equ:mi2}

When the path length is an odd half integer multiple of the wavelength, the recombining light beams will be exactly out of phase. The resulting amplitude of the combined beam will be the difference of the amplitudes of each beam. Moreover, since the amplitudes of the split beams are equal, the combined light beam will have zero amplitude.

By moving one of the mirrors, we can change the path length difference and the relative phase of the light beams. With careful alignment, it is possible to use a laser light source to produce interference. As the path length difference changes, we would see both constructive and destructive interference. By moving Mirror 1 slowly towards the light source, we would see the laser point on screen appear, reach maximum brightness, fade away, and then disappear as the path length difference is increased by one wavelength.

\caption{The path of a dispersed laser beam.}
\label{fig:mi3}
\end{figure}

It is more practical to use a dispersed beam instead of a thin laser beam. In the lab, you will use a convex lens to disperse a laser light source. With a dispersed beam, the interferometer produces an interference pattern on the screen instead of a single point. Figure \ref{fig:mi3} shows the path of a dispersed laser beam at an exaggerated angle.  For convenience, the primary elements of the interferometer are shown in a linear arrangement. The parallel beams reflected towards the screen interact with each other in a constructive or destructive manner, depending on the path length difference. The path length difference, now dependent on the beam angle, $\theta$, is given by $2dcos\theta$.  Since the path difference is dependent on the angle of the beam there will be certain angles where there is constructive interference and certain angles at which there is destructive interference. The condition for constructive interference is now

\begin{equation}
2dcos\theta=m\lambda
\label{equ:mi3}
\end{equation}

Constructive interference at specific angles will give rise to an interference pattern of bright and dark concentric circular {\bf fringes}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mi4}. Note that Equation \ref{equ:mi1} still holds as a special case where $\theta=0$, corresponding to the center of the interference pattern.

With a dispersed beam, we can change the path length difference by moving Mirror 1 and we would see changes in the interference pattern. The interference fringes will move either towards or away from the center of the interference pattern, fringes are either produced or annihilated.  In the center of the interference pattern, we would see the alternating light and dark spot as discussed before. A fringe will be produced or annihilated for every wavelength by which the path length difference is changed. For this reason, very fine control is required to move the mirror. The micrometer screw (see Figure \ref{fig:mi1}) is designed to control and measure the small displacements of Mirror 1.  Mirror 1 is restricted to a path parallel to that of the laser beam. As a result, the distance traveled by Mirror 1 is equal to the change in mirror separation, $\Delta$d. By counting the number of passing fringes corresponding to a measured mirror displacement, we can calculate the wavelength of the laser light. The number of fringes that have passed in a mirror displacement, $\Delta$d, is equal to the number of wavelengths that the path length difference has changed. Therefore, Equation \ref{equ:mi1} implies the wavelength is given by

\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[semithick]
\node[fill,circle,scale=.7]at(0,0){};
\foreach \s in {1,2,...,10}{
\node[line width=(15*exp(-\s*.5)),circle,scale=20-24/(\s),draw]at(0,0){};
}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{An illustration of a concentric interference pattern.}
\label{fig:mi4}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{equation}
\lambda=\dfrac{2\Delta d}{N}
\label{equ:mi4}
\end{equation}

\noindent where N is the number of passing fringes corresponding to the change in mirror separation. 

We can further investigate the interference pattern in order to better understand it's origin. We can measure the fringe spacing of the stationary interference pattern, then compare with predictions made by the theory. Given a constant path difference and constant wavelength, there are values of $\theta$ and m that satisfy Equation \ref{equ:mi3}, which correspond to each fringe. So we have

\begin{equation}
2dcos\theta_N=m_N\lambda
\label{equ:mi5}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\theta_N$ is the angle of the N$^{th}$ fringe from the center of the interference pattern, and $m_N$ is the integer number of wavelengths associated with the N$^{th}$ fringe path difference. If we adjust d so that there is a fringe of maximum brightness at $\theta=0$, then $m_0$ is the value of m that satisfies Equation \ref{equ:mi3} for $\theta=0$. So then

\begin{equation}
2dcos(0)=2d=m_0\lambda
\label{equ:mi6}
\end{equation}

\noindent and $m_0$ is the integer number of wavelengths equal to twice the mirror separation (note that this is a re-statement of Equation \ref{equ:mi1}, the zero angle condition for constructive interference). Since neighboring fringes differ in path length difference by one wavelength,

\begin{equation}
m_0-m_N=N
\label{equ:mi7}
\end{equation}

\noindent Equations \ref{equ:mi5}, \ref{equ:mi6}, and \ref{equ:mi7} together predict that the cosine of the angle between the N$^{th}$ fringe and a fringe at the center of the interference pattern will be given by

\begin{equation}
cos\theta_N=1-\dfrac{N\lambda}{2d}
\label{equ:mi8}
\end{equation}

\noindent By plotting the cosine of the fringe angle versus the fringe number, we can see how well the interference pattern  matches the one predicted by the theory.

\label{fig:mi5}
\end{figure}

The interference pattern is sensitive to changes in the relative phase of the two split beams. So we can use the interferometer to investigate how transparent objects affect the phase of light by placing them in one of the split beam paths. The laboratory apparatus includes an air cell connected to a vacuum system. The air cell is an air tight cylinder with glass windows on both faces. We can use this air cell to investigate the index of refraction of the air inside. Consider an air cell placed in the path of one of the split beams, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mi5}. As a light beam passes though a medium, the wavelength of light is dependent on the index of refraction by the formula

\begin{equation}
\lambda=\dfrac{\lambda_{vac}}{n}
\label{equ:mi9}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\lambda$ is the measured wavelength in the medium, $\lambda_{vac}$ is the wavelength of the light beam measured in a vacuum, and n is the index of refraction of the medium. The number of wavelengths that make up the path length in the air cell, W(p), is given by 

\begin{equation}
W(p)=\dfrac{2t}{\lambda_{cell}}=\dfrac{2t}{\lambda_{vac}}n(p)
\label{equ:mi10}
\end{equation}

where t is the thickness of the cell, $\lambda_{cell}$ is the wavelength of the light in the cell, p is the pressure inside the cell, and n(p) is the index of refraction of air at pressure p. Since the index of refraction is a function of pressure, so is the number of wavelengths in the air cell.

It is important to note that the index of refraction of a material medium is always greater than 1, and the index of refraction of a vacuum is equal to 1. This means that the wavelength (as well as the speed) of a beam of light is a maximum in vacuum conditions. As air is evacuated from the cell, the wavelength of the laser light in the cell will increase as the index of refraction approaches 1. For each wavelength decrease in the cell, the relative phase of the split beams will have undergone one complete cycle. This means that the fringes of the interference pattern will move as the air is evacuated from the cell. The number of passing fringes is equal to the change in number of wavelengths in the air cell. From this we know that the number of passing fringes as the air cell pressure changes from atmospheric pressure to some pressure, p, is equal to the difference in number of wavelengths in the air cell at the two pressures. With Equation \ref{equ:mi10}, we have

\begin{equation}
N=W(p_{atm})-W(p)=\dfrac{2t}{\lambda_{vac}}\left[n(p_{atm})-n(p)\right]
\label{equ:mi11}
\end{equation}

\noindent where p$_{atm}$ is atmospheric pressure, and $N$ is the number of passing fringes as the air cell is evacuated from atmospheric pressure to some pressure p. Re-arranging Equation \ref{equ:mi11} with Equation \ref{equ:mi9} we have

\begin{equation}
1-\dfrac{\lambda N}{2t}=\dfrac{n(p)}{n(p_{atm})}
\label{equ:mi12}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the laser light in air at atmospheric pressure.

Note that the quantities on the left side of Equation \ref{equ:mi12} and the pressure inside the air cell are measurable. We can evacuate the air cell while counting the number of passing fringes and recording the pressure. From this data, we can then calculate the relative index of refraction, n(p)/n(p$_{atm}$), at each of the pressures. This makes it possible to observe how the index of refraction of air is affected by changes in pressure. We can also determine the index of refraction of air at atmospheric pressure from a plot of n(p)/n(p$_{atm}$) versus p. The vertical intercept of this plot yields a value for 1/n(p$_{atm}$) since n(p)=1 at p=0.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Begin by aligning the interferometer. Place the interferometer on the wooden stand. The laser should be mounted on the optical bench such that the laser light passes through the interferometer components. Place the laser about 30cm from the interferometer as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mi1}. Loosen the thumb screw that holds the beam splitter and rotate it so that it is out of the path of the beam.  Now align the laser so that the beam reflects off the center of Mirror 1 {\bf directly back} towards the aperture of the laser. Rotate the beam splitter into the laser path so that it is at an angle of approximately 45$^{\circ}$ to the beam. You should see two laser spots on the screen. Rotate the beam splitter until the spots are as close as possible, then tighten the thumb screw. Use the alignment screws on Mirror 2 to superimpose the two spots on the screen.

Now we will diverge the beam in order to produce the interference pattern. Place the convex lens on the stand in between the interferometer and the laser as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mi1}. Adjust the orientation of the lens until you see the dispersed beam reflecting off the center of Mirror 1. You should now see an interference pattern on the screen. You may need to make fine adjustments using the alignment screws on Mirror 2 in order to center the concentric circle pattern. When the alignment is complete, you should see an image on the screen like the one in Figure \ref{fig:mi4}.

\item Adjust the micrometer knob to a medium reading (approximately 50$\mu$m). In this position the relationship between the micrometer reading and mirror movement is most nearly linear. Turn the micrometer knob about one full turn counterclockwise until the zero on the knob is aligned with the reference mark. You should see moving fringes as the micrometer knob is adjusted. Record the micrometer reading (note each small division corresponds to 1$\mu$m). 

\item You will now use the micrometer to measure the wavelength of the laser light. Take note of the initial position of the micrometer. Always turn the micrometer dial one complete revolution counterclockwise before you start to count fringes, to eliminate mechanical backlash (the slight slippage occurring when the direction of motion in a mechanical instrument is reversed). Turn the micrometer screw slowly counter clockwise while counting the number of passing fringes. After about 70 fringes have passed, record the number of fringes as well the mirror displacement from the micrometer screw. Turn the micrometer screw back to the original position and repeat to obtain two more measurements. 

\item Adjust the micrometer screw so that the center of the interference pattern is an illuminated dot of maximum brightness. This implies that there is constructive interference at $\theta=0^{\circ}$ and Equation \ref{equ:mi6} is satisfied. Measure the radius of each fringe from the center of the interference pattern using the ruler on the back of the screen. Record the radius and the corresponding fringe number. Measure the distance from Mirror 2 to the screen with a ruler. From the fringe radius and the distance to the screen, one can determine the angle of the fringe, $\theta$, in order to compare with the predictions made by Equation \ref{equ:mi8}.

\item Record the air pressure with a barometer.

\item Place the air cell in the component stand in the beam path between the beam splitter and Mirror 1. Be sure that the air cell is parallel with the beam path throughout the entire procedure step. Press the pressure release button on the Nalgene pump in order to be sure that the initial air cell pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. Record the initial pressure reading on the Nalgene pump gauge. Slowly squeeze the pump until the fringe interference pattern has completed one cycle, and record the pressure. Continue to evacuate the air and record the air cell pressure as well as the number of cycles after each passing fringe. Repeat this until the pressure reaches the minimum value and the pump can no longer evacuate air from the cell. When you are finished, be sure to press the pressure release button on the pump. It is important to note that the pressure gauge reads negative values of kPa, therefore, to find the absolute pressure inside the air cell, you must subtract the difference between the pressure on the gauge and the initial pressure reading from the air pressure read on the barometer.
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!units on nalgene pump!!!

\item Remove the air cell from the beam path and replace it with the glass slide apparatus. Rotate the glass slide and observe the effect on the interference pattern. Make as many qualitative observations as you can.

\item Perform any optional investigations as required.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}
There will be measurement error in the mirror displacement which can be taken to be one half the smallest division on the micrometer screw. When counting large numbers of passing fringes, even though you are counting whole numbers, it is a good idea to use an uncertainty of one fringe since there is freedom to move the micrometer without a complete fringe passing. When measuring length with a ruler, the error is usually taken to be one half of the smallest division. The error in pressure can also be taken as one half the smallest division on the pressure gauge.

Systematic errors arise because the apparatus can't be perfectly aligned. It is possible to observe an interference pattern even if the laser is slightly misaligned, however, the instrument will deliver poorer results since the mirror movement mechanism is not calibrated for such a situation. If the alignment procedure is followed, the apparatus should function with reasonable accuracy.

\section{Data Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item (2 marks) A table of values for the number of passing fringes, N, and the corresponding change in mirror separation, $\Delta$d, as measured in procedure step 3, with errors. Include a column of the calculated wavelength with error. Comment on whether or not the results are reasonable (the accepted value of the wavelength of the laser light is 632.816 nm).

\item (2 marks) A table of values for the fringe number, N, with the corresponding fringe radius as measured in procedure step 4, with errors. From the fringe radius and the screen distance, calculate the cos$\theta$ value for each of the fringes, with errors. For this calculation you can assume the beam is perpendicular to the screen and that the beam does not strike the mirrors far from the centre.

\item (2 marks) A plot of cos$\theta$ versus N, with error bars. Is it a linear relationship with reasonable slope and intercept? Comment on whether or not the fringe spacing is consistent with Equation \ref{equ:mi8}. 

\item (2 marks) A table of values for the number of passed fringes, N, and the corresponding pressure, p, as measured in procedure step 6, with errors.  Include a column of the calculated n(p)/n(p$_{atm}$) values. In the calculation, you should use the average of the three wavelength values that you measured in procedure step 3 as the wavelength of the laser light at atmospheric pressure. Also note that the thickness of the air cell is 3.0 cm.

\item (2 marks) A plot of n(p)/n(p$_{atm}$) versus p. Extrapolate the plot to find the n(p)/n(p$_{atm}$) value at zero pressure. From the value of the intercept, determine the index of refraction of air at atmospheric pressure. Comment on whether or not the result is reasonable (the accepted value is 1.00025). Comment on the relationship between the index of refraction of air and pressure.

\item (1 mark) A list of qualitative observations made during procedure step 7. Write a paragraph explaining your observations (note that the index of refraction of glass is around 1.50).

\item (2 bonus marks) Measure the index of refraction of glass using the interferometer. Do this by placing the glass slide on the component stand in the beam path between the beam splitter and Mirror 1 and positioning it so that the glass face is perpendicular to the beam. Using the angle scale very slowly rotate the component stand. Record the number of passed fringes corresponding to the angle of the glass slide around every 10 fringes. Use the calipers to measure the thickness of the glass slide and record the value.

There is some complicated geometry involved in deriving the number of passing fringes as the glass slide is rotated. The relationship between the angle of the glass slide, $\theta$, (measured from the perpendicular position) and the number of passed fringes, N, is


\begin{multline}
N=\dfrac{2t}{\lambda}\dfrac{n_{glass}}{n(p_{atm})}\left[\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{sin^2\theta n(p_{atm})^2}{n^2_{glass}}}}-1\right] \\ +\dfrac{2t}{\lambda}\left[1-cos\theta-\dfrac{n(p_{atm})}{n_{glass}}\dfrac{sin^2\theta}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{sin^2\theta n(p_{atm})^2}{n^2_{glass}}}}\right]
\label{equ:mi13}
\end{multline}

\noindent where t is the thickness of the glass slide, n$_{glass}$ is the index of refraction of the glass slide, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the laser light, and n(p$_{atm}$) is the index of refraction of air at atmospheric pressure. This complicated function can be simplified by expanding it as a Taylor series and using the first term as an approximation to the function. It turns out that the first term approximation is accurate to within 1$\%$ of the true value for angles less than 45 degrees when the index of refraction of the material being tested is between 1.0 and 2.0. The first term of the approximation function is

\begin{equation}
N\approx \dfrac{t}{\lambda}\left[1-\dfrac{n(p_{atm})}{n_{glass}}\right]\theta^2
\label{equ:mi14b}
\end{equation}

\noindent Plot N versus $\theta^2$ and from the slope you will be able to determine the value of the index of refraction of the glass slide. (Note: Angle calculations must be done in radians)

\section{Purpose}
To investigate the interference phenomena resulting from multiple reflections in thin films. To apply this theory to the measurement of the radius of curvature of a lens and the thickness of a thin object such as a hair. 

\section{Theory}
Interference of light is a commonly observed phenomenon. It can be seen in the intricate color patterns produced by thin films of oil on water, by soap bubbles, or by cracks in a piece of glass. These color patterns are caused by the multiple reflection of light between  two surfaces of a thin film of transparent material.

\noindent Consider the reflection of light from a plane parallel film as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fb1}. When  a ray of light from a source S is incident on the surface of the film at point A, the ray splits. Part of the ray is reflected as ray 1 and part is refracted in the direction AF. When the refracted ray reaches F, it will again be split. Part of the refracted ray will be reflected to B and part refracted towards H. At B the ray will again be divided, repeating this process throughout the film. The intensity decreases rapidly from one ray to the next. This process results in two sets of parallel rays, one on each side of the film. If one set of parallel reflected rays is collected by a lens L, and focused at a point P, each ray will have traveled a different distance. Because of the phase relations, constructive or destructive interference will be produced at the point P. This is the effect observed when colors of thin films are observed with the naked eye. In that case L is the lens of the eye, and P lies on the retina.

\end{marginfigure}

In order to find the phase difference between the rays, we must first find the difference in the optical path traversed by a pair of successive rays, such as rays 1 and 2. A more detailed diagram of these two rays is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fb2}. Let d be the thickness of the film, n its index of refraction, $\lambda$ the wavelength of the light, $\varphi$ the angle of incidence, and  the angle of refraction. If BD is perpendicular to ray 1, the optical paths from D and B to the focus of the lens will be equal. Starting at A, ray 2 has the path AFB in the film and ray 1 the path AD in air. The difference, $\Delta$, in these optical paths is given by 

\begin{equation}
\Delta=n\cdot AFB-AD
\label{equ:fb1}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the index of refraction of air is essentially 1.0. If BF is extended to intersect the perpendicular line AE at G, then

\begin{equation}
AF=GF
\label{equ:fb2}
\end{equation}

\noindent because of the equality of the angles of incidence and reflection at the lower surface. Thus we have

\begin{equation}
\Delta=n\cdot GB-AD
\label{equ:fb3}
\end{equation}

\noindent Since

\begin{equation}
GB=GC+CB
\label{equ:fb4}
\end{equation}

\noindent the difference in optical paths can then be written as

\begin{equation}
\Delta=n\cdot (GC+CB)-AD
\label{equ:fb5}
\end{equation}

\noindent Because AC is drawn perpendicular to FB, the thin lines AC and DB represent two successive positions of a wave front reflected from the lower surface. The optical paths must be the same for any ray drawn between two wave fronts. Therefore we may write

\begin{equation}
n\cdot CB=AD
\label{equ:fb6}
\end{equation}

\noindent The path difference then reduces to

\begin{equation}
\Delta=n\cdot GC
\label{equ:fb7}
\end{equation}

\noindent Expressing GC in terms of d and $\theta$ gives us

\begin{equation}
\Delta=n2dcos\theta
\label{equ:fb8}
\end{equation}

If the path difference is a whole number of wavelengths, you might expect rays 1 and 2 to arrive at the focus of the lens in phase with each other and produce a maximum of intensity. However, we must take into account the fact that ray 1 undergoes a phase change of $\pi$ at reflection, while ray 2 does not, since it is internally reflected. The condition

\begin{equation}
m\lambda=2ndcos\theta \hspace{4mm}m=0,1,2,...
\label{equ:fb9}
\end{equation}

\noindent then becomes the condition for maximum {\bf destructive interference}, where m is the order of interference, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light. Maximum {\bf constructive interference} will then occur at half wavelength path differences, such that

\begin{equation}
\left(m+\dfrac{1}{2}\right)\lambda=2ndcos\theta \hspace{4mm}m=0,1,2,...
\label{equ:fb10}
\end{equation}

\noindent Since the human eye is more sensitive to small changes of low intensity of light rather than to small changes of high intensity of light, the dark bands of maximum destructive interference are normally used to make measurements.

In the above derivation, only the interaction of the first two rays was discussed. Since intensity of the ray decreases each time it is divided into a reflected and refracted ray, the first two rays will have the highest intensity, and hence will have the most impact on the interference pattern. This is not to say that the other rays do not affect the interference pattern. On the contrary, the reason complete darkness is observed at maximum destructive interference is because rays 3,4,5,.., are all in phase with ray 2. The addition of all these rays results in an intensity as great as that of ray 1, allowing for complete cancellation. Although inclusion of other rays does affect the magnitude of the interference, they do not change the conditions for maximum constructive or destructive interference.

Names are given to the different types of interference bands that result from varying different factors in Equations \ref{equ:fb9} and \ref{equ:fb10}. If the right hand side of the equation is kept constant and the wavelength is allowed to vary, then for certain wavelengths destructive interference results, whereas for others, constructive interference results, depending on the value of m. These interference bands are known as {\bf fringes of equal chromatic order}, or {\bf FECO bands}. If on the other hand, wavelength is fixed, and the angle of refraction varies, the resulting interference bands are called {\bf Haidinger bands}, or {\bf fringes of equal inclination}. The last type of interference bands, called {\bf Fizeau bands}, are the result of varying d. The distinction between the three types of bands is not absolute though, for more than one factor may vary at the same time, and the types become merged.

The type of interference we wish to investigate here are Fizeau bands in thin films of air. Since we are really concerned with the effects of d on the band pattern, a simplified version of Equation \ref{equ:fb9} can be applied. If the thin transparent film used is air, then the index of refraction will be very close to 1.0. Also, if the angle of incidence is 0$^{\circ}$, then the condition for destructive interference becomes

\begin{equation}
m\lambda=2d
\label{equ:fb11}
\end{equation}

When monochromatic light is used to observe Fizeau bands, they are interpreted in exactly the same manner as the contour lines on a topographical map. The larger the thickness of the film, d, the larger the spacing between the bands. This relationship though, deals with height differences on the order of micrometers, as opposed to height differences on the order of hundreds of meters for topographical maps. Because the distance between Fizeau bands is dependent on the thickness of a thin film, they have many practical uses. They are , for example, used for testing the flatness of optical surfaces. An object is tested by laying it on top of a known optical flat and observing the resultant band pattern. If the bands appear parallel, straight, and equally spaced, then the tested surface is flat.

Fizeau bands were actually one of the first types of interference bands to be observed. They were first seen by Robert Boyle in 1663. He observed them as concentric rings centered around the contact between a long radius convex lens and a flat glass plate, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:fb3}. Because Newton studied these interference bands further, they are now known as {\bf Newton's rings}.

Newton's rings are produced by the air gap between a flat glass plate and a long radius convex lens. An apparatus used to produce such an interference pattern is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fb4}. The curvature of the convex lens is exaggerated in order to demonstrate the desired effect. The lens, in reality, appears, to the naked eye, to be flat. If the convex lens did have a large curvature, the rings would be so close together we would not be able to see them. Since the spacing between the rings decreases as the air gap increases, the ring pattern observed should get closer together as we move outward from the point of contact between the lens and the glass plate. By measuring the change in spacing we can determine the curvature of the convex lens. To see how this can be done, consider again Figure \ref{fig:fb4}. In this figure, R represents the radius of curvature of the convex lens, r$_m$, the distance from the center to the m$^{th}$ ring, and d, the air gap between the lens and the flat glass plate at the m$^{th}$ ring. By applying the Pythagorean theorem we get

\begin{equation}
R^2=(R-d)^2+r_m^2
\label{equ:fb12}
\end{equation}

\noindent By expanding this out and collecting like terms, the equation becomes

\begin{equation}
r_m^2=2Rd\left(1-\dfrac{d}{2R}\right)
\label{equ:fb13}
\end{equation}

\noindent Since d/2R is much smaller than 1, this can be simplified to get

\begin{equation}
r_m^2=2Rd
\label{equ:fb14}
\end{equation}

Combining Equations \ref{equ:fb11} and \ref{equ:fb14} gives a relationship for R in terms of the distance to the m$^{th}$ ring and the wavelength of light used, namely

\begin{equation}
R=\dfrac{r_m^2}{m\lambda}
\label{equ:fb15}
\end{equation}

Fizeau bands can also be used to determine the thickness of very thin objects like hair, paper, or aluminum foil. The thickness of thin objects can be determined through the use of an {\bf air wedge}, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:fb5}. The air wedge works on the same principle as Newton's rings. The larger the air gap, the smaller the separation between the lines. As long as the glass surfaces are perfectly flat, the bands will be straight, otherwise they will tend to curve, forming contour lines from the unevenness in the surfaces.

Suppose that the interference bands are only due to the formation of an air gap caused by the placement of an thin object between two glass slides. We can derive an equation which will give us the thickness of the object in terms of the distance between the object and the edge of the clip, L, and the distance, y, from the object to a point P. From similar triangles we find that

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{d_2}{d_1}=\dfrac{m_2}{m_1}=\dfrac{L}{x}
\label{equ:fb16}
\end{equation}

\noindent where m$_2$ is the number of dark bands from the edge of the object to the edge of the clip, and m$_1$ is the number of dark bands from any point P to the edge of the clip. Because of distortions caused by using a clip to hold the two glass slides together, it is hard to get an accurate value for m$_1$. We can avoid this problem by counting the bands from the edge of the object to some point P, so that

\begin{equation}
m=m_2-m_1
\label{equ:fb17}
\end{equation}

\noindent We then use the corresponding distance y by applying the relation

\begin{equation}
y=L-x
\label{equ:fb18}
\end{equation}

\noindent The thickness of the object, d$_2$, can then be determined by combining Equations \ref{equ:fb11}, \ref{equ:fb16}, \ref{equ:fb17}, and \ref{equ:fb18}, so that

\begin{equation}
d_2=\dfrac{m\lambda}{2}\dfrac{L}{y}
\label{equ:fb19}
\end{equation}

Even though interference bands are visible to the naked eye, their spacing is such that you need a microscope in order to make an accurate measurement. The experimental setup used to measure the spacing between Fizeau bands is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fb6}. A monochromatic light source, in this case a Sodium lamp, illuminates the arrangement thereby keeping $\lambda$ constant. A traveling microscope is used  to count the number of bands and measure the related distances. A beam splitter allows the light to be incident on the Newton's rings or air wedge apparatus surface at nearly 0$^{\circ}$, while allowing us to view the surface at the same angle. This lets us avoid using the cosine term, allowing the use of Equation \ref{equ:fb11}. The microscope sits on the beam splitter stand which is placed on a lab jack so that the beam splitter is at the same height as the light source. The Newton's rings or air wedge  apparatus is placed under the beam splitter on a riser block. The riser block is put in place in order to keep the bands within the focusing range of the microscope.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adjust the Newton's ring apparatus until the rings are visible and centered. This may require cleaning the lenses. To do this remove the screws which hold the two metal rings together. Remove the two lenses to be cleaned, remembering how they were positioned. If the two lenses are not put back together properly a saddle pattern, as opposed to a ring pattern will result. Before using the lens paper and lens cleaning fluid to clean off finger prints, gently blow away any dirt to avoid scratching the lenses. The ring pattern may be centered by adjusting the tension in the screws. Be careful not to tighten the screws too much or the observed pattern will not be caused by the shape of the two lenses, but by the distortion of  the lenses caused by the pressing metal rings.
  
\item Measure the separation between the rings in order to determine the radius of curvature of the convex lens. The path difference at the point of contact between the convex and flat lenses is not necessarily zero. Even if there is no dust and the surfaces actually touch, the pressure between the lenses causes distortion. Hence it is better to measure the distance from say ring 10, as opposed to taking measurements from the center. Since the lines are so closely spaced, it is more accurate to measure the distance between a number of rings. The Newton's ring apparatus should be placed so that light from the sodium lamp, 589.3 nm, is reflected down onto it by the beam splitter. Using the traveling microscope, measure the distance from a set ring, such as ring 10, to at least five other rings. These rings should be separated from each other by at least five rings. When using this method, m is the number of rings between the two measurements, and r$_m$, the separation. 

\item Determine the thickness of a hair using the air wedge method. Make sure that the two glass slides are clean. Place a hair between the two glass slides near one end. Place the clip at the other end. Put the air wedge apparatus on the riser block so that the clip hangs off the edge. This is done so that the air wedge apparatus does not make another air wedge with the riser block. Place the riser block and air wedge apparatus under the beam splitter and use the traveling microscope to observe the interference bands produced using the sodium lamp. The bands observed should be parallel with the hair. If the bands are almost perpendicular with the hair, then the slides need to be cleaned again. Line the microscope up with the interference bands, not the hair. Starting at the edge of the hair closest to the clip, measure the distance between the hair and an m$^{th}$ band. Repeat the measurement for at least five different m values. The value of m used should be no smaller then 10. Measure the distance between the hair and the edge of the clip.
 
\item Repeat step 3 using a piece of aluminum foil to determine its thickness.

\item With a micrometer, measure the thickness of the hair and the aluminum foil. Be sure not to over tighten the micrometer. The clutch at the end of the micrometer must be used to get a correct reading. This ensures a gentle uniform pressure for all micrometer measurements.

\item Perform any optional part of the experiment as desired.

The wavelength value, $\lambda$, along with the number of bands, m, are taken to be exact. This leaves the distance measurements, which do contribute to the error in the final result. Normally when error is taken off a vernier scale it is taken as half the smallest division. Because of complications resulting from lining the microscope up with the bands, error should be considered to be at least the value of the smallest division. When using the micrometer, error should be taken to be half the smallest division.

The values obtained for the curvature of the convex lens, or for the thickness of thin objects, may not be entirely correct. This is because there are some uncontrollable factors that effect the results. Fizeau bands can be used to determine the flatness of an optical object. This means that if an object is not perfectly flat, distortions in the band pattern will result. The glass slides used for the air wedge are not optical flats, therefore, some of the band patterns observed may be due to the distortions in the glass and not in the placement of the thin object. Any dust on the slides or the lenses will also cause variation in the observed ring or band pattern. There is also no guarantee that for the Newton's rings the two lenses are actually touching, or for the air wedge that the slides are making contact with the thin objects. This will cause the values to appear larger then they actually are. A main source of unavoidable error comes from the use of clamping devices, the metal rings on the Newton's rings apparatus, and the clip on the air wedge apparatus. Both of these clamping devices are required to ensure that the two lenses or slides are actually making contact, but they also create distortions.

\begin{enumerate}

\item (1 mark) A derivation of  Equation \ref{equ:fb19}.

\item (2 marks) A table which includes the values m, r$_m$, r$_m^2$, along with their associated error, for the trials done to determine the radius of curvature of the convex lens.

\item (2 marks) A graph of r$_m^2$ versus m and obtain a regression equation for the straight line, including the uncertainty. From this equation recover the value for the radius of curvature of the convex lens along with its uncertainty.

\item (4 marks) Two tables, one for determining the thickness of a hair and one for finding the thickness of a piece of aluminum foil, which contain the values L, m, and y, along with their errors.

\item (4 marks) Two graphs of y versus m, one for the hair and one for the aluminum foil. Obtain the regression equations for the straight lines, including the uncertainty. From the equations recover the values, with uncertainty, for the thickness of the hair and the aluminum foil. 

\item (2 marks) Values for the thickness of the hair and aluminum foil, along with the uncertainty, using the micrometer. Compare the values obtained with the micrometer with those obtained through optical means. Discuss which method is better for measuring thickness.

\item (2 marks) A one paragraph discussion on whether your results support or deny the wave nature of light.

\item (2 bonus marks)  Even though we have been observing Newton's rings through monochromatic light, they can be observed through white light. When this is done the resulting pattern does not strictly result in Fizeau bands, since it is not just d which is changing, but $\lambda$ as well. If all we were doing was varying $\lambda$, then the result would be a FECO band pattern, where color bands would be alternated with dark bands. The resulting colorful ring pattern does not follow a standard white light spectrum either, but instead follows an interference color pattern. This pattern can be seen on the color interference chart provided in the laboratory. The resulting interference pattern is a combination of both Fizeau and FECO bands.

Observe the Newton's ring pattern in white light by placing the Newton's ring apparatus under one of the desk lamps. It is easier to observe the color pattern by using the larger Newton's ring apparatus. Starting from the center, write down the color sequence. Compare this sequence to the one on the chart provided in the laboratory. Does a black spot appear in the center? If not, where in the interference color pattern spectrum does the ring pattern start at? While still looking at the ring pattern under the white light adjust the tension in the tension screws. How does this affect the interference color pattern? Include in your discussion any other observations you make.

\item (2 bonus marks) By illuminating a thin plane parallel reflecting surface with diffuse monochromatic light, fringes of equal inclination can be observed. One way to observe this type of interference pattern is with a thin cover glass and a Sodium lamp. First, place the cover slip on the table in front of the lamp and have a lab partner {\bf carefully} tilt the lamp at an angle. Move your head, or the cover slip, until you can see the reflection of the Sodium lamp in the cover slip. Observe the interference pattern present on the surface of the cover slip. Rotate the cover slip and note what happens.  Observe the appearance of the band pattern as you change your viewing angle. Replace the cover slip with a glass slide and make similar observations. How do the bands produced with the thicker glass slide compare to the bands produced with the cover slip? Include in your discussion any other observations you make.

\section{Preparation}
Study Fraunhofer diffraction and the diffraction of light through a thin slit.

\section{Purpose}
To observe the far-field diffraction patterns for single, double, and multiple slits, and verify qualitatively the theoretical relation bewteen slit width, spacing, and the form of the diffraction patterns. To measure the wavelength of a laser using a diffraction grating and a two-dimensional grid.

\section{Theory}
Suppose, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fd1},  that a laser is shone upon a small slit.  The light passing through the slit is then allowed to fall on a screen, positioned at some distance, L, from the slit, with its plane perpendicular to the path of the light's propagation.  If light traveled in straight lines one would expect the screen to display a single image of the slit with the rest of the screen in shadow.  For a sufficiently small slit, however, it is found that this is not the case.  Instead, a {\bf diffraction pattern} is observed, consisting of a central bright fringe along the slit-screen axis with alternating dark and bright fringes on either side of the central fringe.  It is evident, based on this observation, that light does not travel in straight lines since bright fringes are seen where shadow would be expected.  It follows then, that light has the property of being able to "bend" around corners, a property called {\bf diffraction}.

In order to examine diffraction we will assume that light behaves like a wave.  With this assumption one can imagine a beam of light to consist of a series of wave fronts aligned perpendicular to the direction of light propagation. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:fd2}, a {\bf ray} can be drawn perpendicular to the wave fronts, indicating the direction of light propagation.  This wave model of light allows us to make use of {\bf Huygen's principle} which claims that any point on a wave front can itself be regarded as a point source emitting circular wave fronts.  Applying this principle to the situation under consideration, every point located in the slit acts as a point source. Consequently, the diffraction pattern must be the result of the constructive and destructive interference of the various waves generated by these point sources.

Diffraction phenomena are usually separated into two different types called {\bf Fraunhofer} (far field) and {\bf Fresnel} (near field) diffraction. The former describes the diffraction pattern observed in the far field (i.e. at large values of L) where rays of light incident upon the observing screen are almost parallel to one another. As might be expected, Fresnel diffraction describes the near-field pattern observed when the screen is placed close to the slit (i.e. at small values of L).  The expected image of the slit is cast on the screen without diffraction only in the limiting case when L$ = 0$.  Since Fresnel diffraction is complicated to analyze mathematically we will restrict our attention to Fraunhofer diffraction.

\caption{Incident light rays passing through a slit.}
\label{fig:fd3}
\end{figure}

To begin a more careful analysis of diffraction phenomena, we examine the single slit described earlier in more detail.  Figure \ref{fig:fd3} shows a slit of width, a, viewed from above.  Note that the rays incident upon the slit must be parallel and in phase.  The laser is used in this experiment to ensure that this is the case.  It also has the added advantage of being monochromatic so that all rays have the same wavelength.  Assume that the aperture to screen distance is much larger than the size of the aperture.  With this assumption, rays arriving at point P on the screen can be considered parallel to one another.  To determine the conditions necessary for the appearance of a dark fringe at P it is convenient to consider rays that are half the slit width apart from one another.  In Figure \ref{fig:fd3} each of the rays are separated by a distance of a/4 so that rays 5 and 3, 4 and 2, and 3 and 1 are half the slit width removed from one another. Note that one member of each of these pairs of rays must travel a small extra distance, $\Delta$p, before reaching the screen.  As determined from the geometry depicted in Figure \ref{fig:fd3}, this distance is given by the equation

\begin{equation}
\Delta p=\dfrac{a}{2}sin\theta
\label{equ:fd1}
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is the angle between the optical axis and the rays emitted by point sources located along the slit width, converging upon point P.  Equation \ref{equ:fd1} holds true for all pairs of rays that pass through the slit a distance a/2 apart.

In order to obtain a dark fringe on the screen at the angle $\theta$ from the optical axis the waves generated by the point sources in the slit must interfere destructively.  For each of the aforementioned pairs of rays, this condition is met if the path difference between the rays is half the wavelength, $\lambda$, of the laser.  If, for example, the point of arrival of ray 3 at the screen corresponds to a peak in the wave then ray 1, which has to travel the extra distance $\lambda/2$, will arrive at the screen as a trough.  The trough and peak cancel each other resulting in a dark point on the screen.  It follows from Equation \ref{equ:fd1} that the condition for a dark fringe caused by the interaction of waves generated by points in the slit separated by half the slit-width is given by

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{a}{2}sin\theta=\dfrac{\lambda}{2}
\label{equ:fd2}
\end{equation}

We can repeat the analysis for pairs of rays separated by one quarter the slit width resulting in the condition 

\begin{equation}
sin\theta=\dfrac{2\lambda}{a}
\label{equ:fd3}
\end{equation}

for a dark fringe.  Similarly, for pairs of rays separated by one sixth the slit width we find that a dark fringe is produced at the angle $\theta$ if the condition 

\begin{equation}
sin\theta=\dfrac{3\lambda}{a}
\label{equ:fd4}
\end{equation}

\noindent is met.

Generalizing, based on the pattern established by Equations \ref{equ:fd2}, \ref{equ:fd3}, and \ref{equ:fd4}, it follows that a dark fringe appears at an angle $\theta$ if it satisfies the equation 

\begin{equation}
sin\theta=m\dfrac{\lambda}{a}\hspace{4mm} (m=\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,...)
\label{equ:fd5}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:fd5} shows that the structure of the diffraction pattern depends on the both the wavelength of the light illuminating the slit and the slit width.

Having now considered the diffraction pattern generated by a single slit we turn our attention to the {\bf diffraction grating}.  A grating consists of a large number of parallel slits and is characterized by the so-called grating constant, d, which is the center to center distance between two adjacent slits.  If we replace the single slit in Figure \ref{fig:fd1} by a diffraction grating we will find that the grating generates a diffraction pattern similar to that of the slit.  In the case of the grating, however, the light fringes are considerably more compact and, as a consequence, we shall focus our attention on the light fringes rather than the dark fringes in this analysis.

Figure \ref{fig:fd4} shows a number of rays exiting from a small section of the diffraction grating and arriving at the screen.

Assume that the distance L is large enough that we can consider the rays depicted to be essentially parallel.  According to the geometry illustrated here the condition for a light fringe, also called a maximum, appearing at the angle $\theta$ with respect to the optical axis is given by the equation 

\begin{equation}
dsin\theta=m\lambda\hspace{4mm}(m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,...)
\label{equ:fd6}
\end{equation}

Let x be the distance from the central maximum (m = 0) to some other maximum, identified by a non-zero value of m.  With this definition the sine term in Equation \ref{equ:fd6} can be replaced to obtain

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{xd}{\sqrt{x^2+L^2}}=m\lambda

Equation \ref{equ:fd7} is simpler to verify experimentally than Equation \ref{equ:fd6} since x and L are more easily measured than the angle $\theta$.

So far we have been considering diffraction patterns that extend along a single axis.  To conclude this exploration of diffraction phenomena, the two dimensional diffraction pattern created by a grid of small square openings, as shown in Figure 4, will be examined.  

The conditions governing the two dimensional diffraction pattern can be analyzed by considering the openings along the x and y axis, as defined in Figure \ref{fig:fd5}, separately.  Any line of squares along the x-direction behaves in the same fashion as a regular diffraction grating with a center to center slit distance d.  Hence the component of the diffraction pattern due to horizontal lines of the grid must obey Equations \ref{equ:fd6} and \ref{equ:fd7}.  Similarly any line of squares along the y-direction behaves like a regular diffraction grating also with a center to center slit distance d.  The resulting diffraction pattern will, however, lie perpendicular to those created by lines of squares aligned parallel to the x-axis.  Again, Equation \ref{equ:fd6} applies but in order for Equation \ref{equ:fd7} to apply the 'x' must be replaced by 'y' giving

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{yd}{\sqrt{y^2+L^2}}=m\lambda
\label{equ:fd8}
\end{equation}

The diffraction pattern observed on the screen is a result of the superposition of the diffraction patterns created by both the horizontal and vertical lines of squares.  This pattern will consist of a square array of bright dots decreasing in intensity away from the optical axis of the system.  

Position measurements of maxima for the diffraction grating and grid will allow us to determine the wavelength of the laser via Equation \ref{equ:fd7}.   A similar calculation of laser wavelength using the dark fringes of the single slit diffraction pattern can also be made.

Figure \ref{fig:fd6} shows the experimental arrangement that will be used to study diffraction patterns.  The laser, mounted on the optics bench by means of the two-axis translation stage, shines on the slide holder which holds one of the various diffraction slides or gratings. The translation stage is used to accurately adjust the x and y position of the laser. The resulting diffraction pattern is observed on the screen.

The diffraction pattern created by a number of different slides can be measured on the screen located at a known distance, L. Equations \ref{equ:fd7} and \ref{equ:fd8} are then used to determine the wavelength of the laser light used in this experiment.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Arrange the equipment so that the laser and screen are at opposite ends of the optics bench with the slide holder positioned quite close ( 5.00 cm) to the laser. Throughout this experiment it is important to remember that looking directly into the laser can cause retinal damage. As a consequence the optics bench should be positioned so that the laser is directed towards the wall, away from other people.

\item  Place the slide consisting of four single slits with openings of 0.02 mm, 0.04 mm, 0.08 mm, and 0.16 mm in the slide holder. Adjust the two-axis translation stage so that the beam of the laser passes through the largest slit. Repeat the process for the remaining three slits. Describe qualitatively the diffraction pattern for each slit and note the effect of decreasing slit width on the single slit diffraction patterns.

\item  Replace the single slit slide with the slide consisting of four double slits of varying width and slit spacing.  Compare the resulting diffraction patterns and note, qualitatively, how slit width and spacing affect the pattern.

\item  Replace the double slit slide with the multiple slit slide consisting of four multiple slit patterns with the same width and spacing.  Compare the resulting diffraction pattern and note, qualitatively, how the number of slits affects the diffraction pattern.

\item  Replace the multiple slit slide with the slide consisting of three diffraction gratings.  Remove the screen from the optical bench so that the laser is allowed to pass through the grating with the resulting diffraction pattern displayed on the wall.  The wall is used in this portion of the experiment because the diffraction pattern does not fit on the screen.  Make sure the grating is positioned perpendicular to the optical axis.  This can be accomplished by twisting the slide holder so that  the distance between adjacent maxima of the diffraction pattern is a minimum.  Adjust the two-axis translation stage so that the laser is incident upon the grating ruled with 2400 lines/inch.  (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

\item  Using the tape measure determine the distance, L, between the central maximum displayed on the wall and the diffraction grating.  For at least six maxima on one side of the central maximum measure the displacement, x, from the central maximum.

\item  Replace the diffraction grating slide in the slide holder with one of the nylon grid slides.  Re-attach the screen to the optics bench and measure the grid to screen distance using the optic bench scale.  

\item  For each of the seven nylon grid slides (each labeled with the center to center distance, d, of two adjacent squares in its grid) measure the distance, x (or y) between the central maximum and either the sixth or seventh maximum.  This measurement is most easily accomplished by placing a blank sheet of paper directly on the screen and marking, in pencil, the position of the central and sixth or seventh maximum.  Calipers can then be used to obtain an accurate measure of the distance.  Maxima closer to the central maximum than the sixth tend to be at distances that are too small to measure accurately.

Make sure the maximum you choose to measure, whether it be the sixth or seventh, is readily observable in at least one of the two axes of the diffraction pattern for each slide in the set.  The intensity of each maximum falls off quite rapidly away from the central bright spot and, in some instances, a maximum may appear to be missing altogether.  this is a consequence of the fact that each square of the grid creates its own single slit diffraction pattern which may interfere with the overall pattern of the grid. Before making your measurements be sure the grid is positioned in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis using the method specified in step 5.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Error Analysis}
The error in all measured distances is half the smallest division of the scale from which they are read.  In the course of the experiment it will be necessary to determine the error in the term x/(x2+L2)$^{^1/_2}$ from the errors u(x) in x and u(L) in L.  A rigorous calculation of this error for each set of measurements is a time-consuming process.  As a consequence, assume that measurements of x are exact so that the error in this term, as determined from u(L), alone using standard methods, is given by

\begin{equation}
u\left[\dfrac{x}{(x^2+L^2)^{^1/_2}}\right]=\dfrac{Lx}{(x^2+L^2)^{^3/_2}}u(L)
\label{equ:fd9}
\end{equation}
