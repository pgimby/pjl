\end{itemize}
%To understand some ideas and properties of traveling waves and gain experience with pulse and timing measurements using an oscilloscope. Also, to appreciate the wide range of physical situations where traveling wave ideas apply. 

\section{Theory}
Imagine a rope fixed to a wall and under tension at the free end. When this free end is flipped upwards once a wave travels down the rope until it reaches the wall. Here, the wave exerts a force on the wall and the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the rope. The result is a wave opposite to the original wave traveling back on the rope in the reverse direction. The incident wave has been {\bf reflected} by the wall. As a second example, suppose now that one end of the rope is free to move up and down because it has been connected to a ring that is free to slide on a frictionless rod perpendicular to the rope. Now, when the free end is flipped up once, a wave travels down the rope as before. When this wave reaches the ring the force of the wave raises the ring which then falls back down to generate a wave travelling back down the rope. Unlike the solid wall, this wave is identical to the original wave, instead of opposite.

These two examples demonstrate that a wave on a rope is reflected by both a {\bf fixed rope termination} as well as a {\bf free rope termination}. The fixed and free rope ends are the extreme cases. In an intermediate case, where the rope termination is partly free (or partly fixed), the incident wave will be reflected back with varying intensities and can be opposite or identical, depending on whether the termination is closer to a free end or a fixed end. This logically implies there must be one termination exactly in between which produces no reflection. This {\bf proper termination} occurs when the rope end has a resistance to the wave that is exactly the same as the resistance of the rope itself. From the point of view of the rope, the wave continues onward without interruption because the wave only sees more identical rope ahead. From the point of view of an external observer, the proper termination has absorbed the wave and produced no reflection. This single value of resistance that absorbs waves instead of reflecting them is called the {\bf characteristic impedance}, $Z_0$. If the rope were thinner or more compliant the characteristic impedance would change. 

A second wave property of the rope is the velocity at which the wave propagates along the rope. Giving a harder flip will increase the height of the wave but it will not travel down the rope any faster. This {\bf velocity of propagation}, $V_p$, is dependent on the thickness and compliance of the rope. One can image reversing the rope so the formerly terminated end is now the end to be flipped. The waves will propagate and reflect on the rope the same as before. For the rope then, the characteristic impedance and velocity of propagation are identical for the the forward traveling waves and the reverse traveling reflected waves.

What happens if the rope is flipped twice so that the reflected wave from the first flip must cross the incoming wave of the second flip? The result is determined by a third property of the rope called the {\bf principle of superposition}. This principle states that when two waves overlap, the resulting vertical displacement of the rope (the height or {\bf amplitude}), is the sum of the individual displacements of each wave. The waves themselves do not interfere with each other. After the waves have crossed, each carries on as before without any change in speed or amplitude.

If the rope were ideal, or {\bf lossless}, then the traveling waves would never lose any energy. In practice, a wave traveling on a rope loses a constant fraction of its amplitude per meter of travel along the rope. This {\bf attenuation}, or {\bf loss factor}, of the rope is a fourth characteristic  property of the rope. Due to attenuation, a wave traveling on a very long rope will slowly decay away. In this experiment you will be observing and verifying each of these four properties.

The waves on a rope are an example of a mechanical traveling wave. Traveling wave phenomena occur in any situation where the travel time of a wave along the medium is significantly larger than the size of the wave. Examples of this are everywhere. Bats use acoustic traveling waves in air to locate their prey and avoid obstacles. Dolphins and submarines do the same with acoustic waves in water. The wake from a boat generates surface traveling waves on top of the water that take some time to reach the shore. Striking a hammer on a steel beam generates traveling waves in a solid medium. A sudden application and removal of heat generates a heat wave that travels by conduction. The sudden diffusion that occurs when one material is added to another is also a traveling wave. Lastly, electrical signals in wires and electromagnetic waves in space furnish many examples of traveling waves.

The size and speed of a traveling wave system can vary greatly. The yearly thermal cycle on a concrete dam generates waves with widths in the tens of meters. On the other hand, in a high frequency radar set the waves travel millimeters in a few nanoseconds. This experiment will examine electrical pulses in cables several meters long. The waves will travel the length of the cable in several tens of nanoseconds. This system is used for traveling wave experiments because it closely approximates an ideal traveling wave system. Furthermore, it is easy and fast to make direct measurements on the traveling waves and the cables are small and easily handled. This experiment would not be so easy to perform with yearly thermal waves in a concrete dam.

Let x be the position of the wave and t the time. Then all lossless linear traveling wave systems obey the {\bf telegrapher's equations}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial x}=-\dfrac{Z_0}{V_p}\cdot\dfrac{\partial i}{\partial t}
\label{equ:tw1}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial i}{\partial x}=-\dfrac{1}{V_pZ_0}\cdot\dfrac{\partial v}{\partial t}
\label{equ:tw2}
\end{equation}

Since this experiment deals with electrical pulses on a cable, the variable $v$ represents the voltage and the variable $i$ represents the current. For any other traveling wave system they would represent some other relevant physical quantities. The partial derivatives are required because the wave depends on both the position and the time. Hence the voltage, $v$, is really a function $v(x,t)$, and the current, $i$, is really a function $i(x,t)$. The solutions to the telegraphers equations are

\begin{equation}
v(x,t)=f(x-V_pt)+g(x+V_pt)
\label{equ:tw3}
\end{equation}

\noindent and

\begin{equation}
i(x,t)=\dfrac{1}{Z_0}\left[f(x-V_pt)-g(x+V_pt)\right]
\label{equ:tw4}
\end{equation}

The solution functions $f$ and $g$ are {\bf arbitrary}. This means it does not matter what shape the traveling wave may have, the general behaviour remains unchanged.  Both the $f$ and $g$ functions each satisfy the telegrapher's equations alone. The reason for this is that $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary, so either $f$ or $g$ could be identically zero. This allows us to examine $f$ and $g$ independently. For $f$, as long as $x$ is increased with velocity, $V_p$ , the value of $f(x,t)$ remains unchanged. So $f$ is a wave traveling in the positive $x$ direction. Similarly, $g$ is a wave traveling in the negative $x$ direction. Set $g $to zero so the forward wave can be examined. Dividing Equation \ref{equ:tw3} by Equation \ref{equ:tw4} gives

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{v(x,t)}{i(x,t)}=Z_0
\label{equ:tw5}
\end{equation}

\noindent which is a travelling wave version of Ohm's law. For the reverse wave g, the result is

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{v(x,t)}{i(x,t)}=-Z_0
\label{equ:tw6}
\end{equation}

It is now possible to describe reflections quantitatively. Imagine a wave traveling on a cable that is terminated in a load $Z_T$ and has a characteristic impedance $Z_0$. Let $v^+$ be the voltage traveling toward the load and $v^-$ be the voltage reflected from the load. The voltage at the load (terminated end) must be

\begin{equation}
v_T=v^++v^-
\label{equ:tw7}
\end{equation}

\noindent and using Equations \ref{equ:tw5} and \ref{equ:tw6}, the current must be

\begin{equation}
i_T=i^++i^-=\dfrac{1}{Z_0}\left(v^+-v^-\right)
\label{equ:tw8}
\end{equation}

\noindent The voltages and currents at the terminated end are determined by the load $Z_T$, which means

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{v_T}{i_T}=Z_T=\dfrac{v^++v^-}{v^+/Z_0-v^-/Z_0}=Z_0\dfrac{v^++v^-}{v^+-v^-}
\label{equ:tw9}
\end{equation}

\noindent Define the {\bf reflection coefficient} to be the ratio of the reflected voltage to the incident voltage

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_r=\dfrac{v^-}{v^+}
\label{equ:tw10}
\end{equation}

\noindent Using Equation \ref{equ:tw9} this can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_r=\dfrac{Z_T-Z_0}{Z_T+Z_0}
\label{equ:tw11}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{equ:tw11} is our desired result. It predicts what the reflection voltage should be for any type of termination. If the load resistance is equal to the characteristic impedance the reflection coefficient is zero.  When the termination is $Z_T = 0$ (a shorted end), the reflection coefficient is $-1$. When the termination is infinite (an open end), the reflection coefficient is $+1$. This corresponds exactly to what was discussed in the rope example.

\section{Experimental Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Connect the output of the pulse generator to the input of the oscilloscope through the feedthrough termination supplied on the oscilloscope. This termination makes the input of the oscilloscope have the same characteristic impedance as the output of the pulse generator so that reflections are eliminated. Set up the pulse generator for maximum amplitude and minimum pulse width. Adjust the pulse period so that the pulses (waves) are spaced 5 microseconds apart. The remaining pushbuttons on the pulse generator must be in the out position, except for POS and INT LOAD which must be pushed in. The pulse generator is now set up to generate waves that are narrow enough and spaced far enough apart that reflections can easily be observed. Set the horizontal mode of the oscilloscope to MAG with a magnification of $\times$10. 

\item Determine the maximum and minimum values of the pulse. Also, measure the time it takes for the signal to rise from minimum to maximum (the {\bf rise time}), and from maximum to minimum (the {\bf fall time}). Measure the width of the pulse at the half height point. Make two sketches of this wave. One diagram should illustrate a single pulse in detail. The other diagram should illustrate what a train of pulses looks like. Include relevant measurements on the diagrams. 

\item  Connect the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:tw1}. Observe the reflected pulse and determine the time between the initial pulse and the reflected pulse. Also, measure the amplitude of the initial and reflected pulses. From these you will be able to determine the velocity of propagation and the attenuation of the wave medium (the RG58 cable). Draw a diagram. Connect a short circuit termination to the end of the cable. Draw a diagram with relevant measurements for this case. Repeat this step for the RG59 and twinaxial cables.

\end{figure}

\item Remove the short circuit termination and connect the variable resistor termination. Adjust the resistor until there is no reflection. Remove the variable termination from the circuit and use the Fluke meter to measure its resistance. This is the value for the characteristic impedance of RG58 cable. Now vary the resistance over its entire range. At each point measure the resistance of the termination and the corresponding amplitude of the initial and reflected waves. Take enough data so that you will be able to verify or refute Equation \ref{equ:tw11}.

\item Remove the variable resistance and leave the cable end open. Increase the pulse width until the outgoing pulse overlaps the reflected pulse. Draw a diagram and take amplitude measurements that will allow you to verify or refute the principle of superposition. Decrease the pulse width back to minimum.

\item Connect the 7.0 m RG59 cable to the end of the RG58 cable. Terminate the open end with a short. Sketch what you observe. Describe what each reflected wave represents. Apply the variable resistive termination to the end of the RG59 cable to measure its characteristic impedance. Repeat with the 7.0 m twinaxial cable. %Measure the velocity of propagation. Repeat with the 7.0 m twinaxial cable. Take enough amplitude data so that you can determine which cable type is lossier, RG59 or twinaxial.

\item Set up the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:tw2}. Connect one end of the 10.0 m RG58 cable to the t-splitter (connected to channel 1) and the other end to channel 2 of the oscilloscope via the feedthrough termination. Set the oscilloscope display to show both channels 1 and 2 and record the voltage differences between the direct output of the pulse generator and the attenuated signal from the cable. Next, measure the time separation between each pulse to determine the phase velocity of the cable. Repeat with the RG59 and twinaxial cables.

\section{Error Analysis}

The uncertainty in measuring the voltage and the time of the wave is the instrument error of the oscilloscope. Assume that the scale on the oscilloscope screen is a ruler. Then the error is one half of the smallest division. Each division in the horizontal direction will have a size determined by the horizontal oscilloscope setting. Similarly, a vertical division is determined by the vertical oscilloscope setting. Take the length of each cable to be exact. For the multimeter, the error is the instrument error as written on the underside of the meter.

\section{Prelab}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Look up values for the characteristic impedance, $Z_0$, and propagation velocity, $V_p$, of RG58 and RG59 cable.

\end{enumerate}
%%% end prelab %%%

\section{{\bf Data Requirements}}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\item Two diagrams with measurements and errors that show a single pulse at high time resolution and multiple pulses at lower time resolution for the case of a  direct connection between the pulse generator and the oscilloscope. The y axis is voltage and the horizontal axis is time. 

{\it Note: When producing diagrams from the output of the oscilloscope be sure to record the time and voltage scale settings from the oscilloscope so that fiducial markers may be interpreted correctly for reporting of time and voltage differences.}

\item Two diagrams with measurements and errors that illustrate reflections from an open end and a shorted end in the RG58 cable. Explain whether or not  your measurements agree with the predictions of the theory.

\item A value with error for $Z_0$ and $V_p$ for the RG58, RG59, and twinaxial cables as well as a value for attenuation for the RG58 cable. The units of characteristic impedance are Ohms. Express the velocity of propagation as a percentage of the speed of light. Express the attenuation in percentage loss per meter of cable.

\item Knowing $V_p$, add a horizontal position axis to the figures in part 2 so the waves are known in time and space. How wide is the pulse generator pulse in nanoseconds and in meters?

\item A table of values for the variable resistive termination. Include, termination resistance, forward voltage, reflected voltage, measured reflection coefficient, and expected reflection coefficient. To get a more realistic value for the measured reflection coefficient use your data for loss in the RG58 cable to determine better values for the forward and reflected voltage at the terminated cable end.

\item A diagram along with measurements and errors for the case where the outgoing pulse is superimposed on the reflected pulse.

\item Two diagrams for the observed pulses when the RG59 and twinaxial cables are connected to the end of the RG58. No measurements are needed but you need to explain the source for each of the reflections that you observe. 

\section{Discussion}

\item A comparison between the measured and expected values for the characteristic impedance and velocity of propagation of RG58 and RG59 cables.

\item Using the results of procedure step 4, discuss whether your results support or refute Equation \ref{equ:tw11}. 

\item Using the results of procedure step 5, discuss whether your results support the principle of superposition for signals in the cable.

\item Discuss in a paragraph one of the following.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]

\item Technicians who must repair undersea or buried cables use an instrument called a {\bf time-domain reflectometer} (TDR) to find where the cable is cut. TDR uses traveling waves to find cable breaks. Using traveling wave ideas describe how you would find a cable break. Include a hypothetical example together with some numeric calculations.

\item Traveling wave ideas also apply to the flow of automobile traffic. What would a change in the characteristic impedance be caused by? On the highway you encounter a sudden slowdown and shortly thereafter traffic resumes normal speed. No accident or obstruction is anywhere in sight. What has just happened?

\item To characterize large explosions, including nuclear ones, the position and time of the blast front needs to be measured. One way to do this is to have a collapsible cable that crushes flat as the blast moves along. The collapsing end represents a shorted termination that moves along with the explosion. How would you measure the advancing shock front using traveling waves in such a cable?
