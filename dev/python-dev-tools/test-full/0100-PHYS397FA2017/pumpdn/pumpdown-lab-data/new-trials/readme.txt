New Trials Readme
=================

This folder contains a list of Vernier Loggerpro data files that were used to test whether or not a different instrumentation amplifier could maintain the calibration from another file using a different amplifier. All of the pumpdown and leakout curves contained in this folder that were collected with the second instrumentation amplifier matched those that were measured using the first amplifier. Therefore, it was decided that the calibration from any instrumentation ampifier could be transferred to others.
