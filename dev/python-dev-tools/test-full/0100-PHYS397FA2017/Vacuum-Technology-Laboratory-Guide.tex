{\subsection{Notes to the Instructor}
{\bf Equipmnent Care:}

Startup procedure for diffstak vacuum system.\newline
A) Turn on water for cooling system\newline
B) Close vent valve, main chamber valve, chamber backing valve, and backing valve.\newline
C) Turn on mechanical pump, and guage controller.\newline
D) Open backing valve and chamber backing valve, and pump on system until pressure in main chamber, and backing pipe have a pressure of less then 10mTorr.\newline
E) Turn on diffusion pumb, and allow the oil to warm up for 10 minutes.\newline
F) Open main chamber valve. If the backing pressure raises above 50mTorr close the main chamber valve and allow the mechanical pump or pump on the system for another 30 minutes. Continue this until the backing pressure remains below 50mTorr.\newline
G) Turn on ion Guage.\newline

Shutdown procedure for diffstak vacuum system.\newline
A) Close main chamber valve, and turn off diffusion pump.\newline 
B) Allow water to run for 30 minutes.\newline
C) Turn off water, mechanical pumb, and guages. Do not open vent valve.\newline

Startup procedure for the Turbo Molecular Pump.\newline
A) Turn on water for cooling system.\newline
B) Turn on guages, and mechanical pump.\newline
C) Pump on the backing side of the system until the backing pressure is less then 5mTorr.\newline
D) Open the main chamber up to the mechanical pump and allow it to pump down on the whole system until the chamber is less then 5mTorre.\newline
E) Turn on the turbo pump with high frequency and pump down on the whole system.\newline
F) Turn on the ion gauge and keep an eye on the progress. The system should eventually bottom out the ion guage.\newline
G) Once the pressure is in 10e-7 the ion pump can be turned on to help with pump down.\newline
H) Once the load on the ion pump is low turn the frequency of the turbo pump to low.\newline

Shutdown procedure for the Turbo Molecular Pump.\newline
A) Close the main chamber valve. \newline
B) Turn off ion pump and turbo molecular pump.\newline
C) Alow system to cool for 30 minutes.\newline
D) Turn of water, mechanical pump, and guages.\newline

{\bf Common Errors made by Students:}
No notes on common errors made by students

{\bf Sample Data:}
No sample data.

\subsection{Maintenance}

A) If a pump has not been used for awhile it may need to be seasoned. An unseasoned pump can appear as a leak in the system. The pump may need to be ran for up to a week in order remove excess water and other contaminants from the system. \newline
B) Check the colour and level of the oil in the mechanical pumps before each use.\newline
C) Check vacuum log for further instruction on when to change the oil of the diffstack and turbo pumps.\newline
